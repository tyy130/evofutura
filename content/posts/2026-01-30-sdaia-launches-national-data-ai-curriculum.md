title: SDAIA launches national data, AI curriculum
---

RIYADH: The Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority has launched the National Cross-Disciplinary Curriculum for University Students in Data and AI.

It provides university students with practical fundamentals for understanding data and using AI tools responsibly to support learning, work and decision-making.

The launch took place during the International Conference on Data and AI Capacity Building, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Friday.

The SDAIA organized the conference, which took place from Jan. 28-29, in academic partnership with King Saud University, knowledge partnership with the Human Capability Development Program, and strategic partnership with Elm.

The curriculum targets all undergraduates across disciplines at Saudi universities. It enables universities to develop a mandatory course in data and AI for all academic programs and ensures a minimum level of core knowledge and skills for every student.

It also enables non-specialists to use AI in their fields through tools, applications, and use cases instead of limiting it to computer science disciplines.

The curriculum helps provide the skills needed for application and practice in the labor market.
