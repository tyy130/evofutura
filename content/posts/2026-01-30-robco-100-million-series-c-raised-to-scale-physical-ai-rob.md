RobCo, a Munich-founded physical AI-driven robotics company, has raised $100 million in Series C funding to advance its "Physical AI" roadmap, expand enterprise deployments, and deepen its presence in the U.S. market.

The round was co-led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Lingotto Innovation, an investment management company owned by Exor. Additional investors participating include Sequoia Capital, Greenfield Partners, Kindred Capital, Leitmotif, and The Friedkin Group. RobCo positioned the syndicate as a mix of venture investors with experience scaling software-led technology companies and industrial backers with long-term relationships and sector connectivity.

The company emphasized its vertically integrated approach, developing hardware and software together as a full-stack system, and described its robots as capable of learning task-specific skills through demonstration and self-learning rather than manual programming. RobCo also framed its product as a "single pane of glass" for customers managing deployments.

The company's expansion strategy is increasingly U.S.-focused. RobCo entered the U.S. in 2025 and now operates in San Francisco and Austin, describing the country as both a strategic priority and a major growth market as manufacturers pursue automation amid labor constraints, reshoring initiatives, and rising operational complexity. RobCo said its robots are deployed across multiple industrial environments, naming BMW and additional customers including DynaEnergetics, Fabricated Extrusion Company, T-Systems, and Rosenberger.

RobCo said it delivers its Autonomous Manufacturing ...
