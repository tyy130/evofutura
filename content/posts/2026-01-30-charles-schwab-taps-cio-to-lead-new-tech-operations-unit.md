AI is ushering in enormous change to the enterprise as CEOs push to realize the technology's benefits. In some cases, companies are turning to CIOs to take on additional responsibilities and connect data and infrastructure with outcomes.

Nearly two-thirds of executives said AI has reframed their roles within the organization, according to a December report from IT management vendor Atera. The newly defined CIO role at Charles Schwab is a sign of the close tie between technology and enterprise operations.

CIOs are navigating expanded responsibilities and facing pressure to deliver tools that will create ROI. Nearly eight in 10 executives believe AI will start significantly contributing to enterprise revenue by 2030 as the technology redefines business operations, according to a study published by the IBM Institute for Business Value.

A year later, Wurster said the firm is still relying on the technology to improve internal processes.
