It says that AI companies, and lawmakers and regulators, should adhere to a 'CLEAR' framework. That stands for: Consent first; Licensing, not scraping; Ethical use of training data; Accountability; and Remuneration and rights.

ISM CEO Deborah Annetts says, "Generative AI is having an enormously damaging impact on the jobs of our musicians and more generally our creators. Our new report shows thi...
