Every year at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), agriculture shows up alongside autonomous vehicles and AI. And every year the same question comes up: Is this finally the year robots replace farm labor?

After moderating a panel on robotics and autonomy, the answer is still no. And that is exactly why robotics in the produce industry are finally starting to work.

What came through clearly in the discussion at CES is that the most successful robots are not trying to replace people; they are fixing the parts of produce operations that break most easily.

Produce is unforgiving. Harvest windows are short, quality drops fast. When labor does not show up on time, fruit stays in the field and value disappears.

That reality shaped much of the CES panel discussion.

Robotics that gain traction in produce tend to focus on timing and flow rather than full automation of complex biological tasks.

One of the strongest themes from the panel was that movement matters more than manipulation.

Harvest-assist platforms, autonomous carts in berries, and rolling systems in greenhouses do not replace workers. They remove walking, lifting, and waiting from the workday, making crews more productive, safer, and easier to retain.

Charlie Andersen, CEO of Burro, said, "The goal isn't to replace people. It's to take away the worst parts of the job so people can focus on the work that actually matters."
