In its relentless pursuit of tax compliance, the South African Revenue Service (Sars) has launched a series of initiatives aimed at streamlining tax processes through various automation enhancements.

Through the leveraging of artificial intelligence (AI), data science and system modernisation, Sars have embarked on their three- to five-year plan to shift to a real-time risk profiling system, including automation of an intelligent tax administration platform.

Flowing from automated processing, the data-driven insights inform Sars of all transactional records pertaining to specific taxpayers, and using AI, the "fine-tooth comb" is no longer needed to extrapolate these records into strong legal cases for non-compliance.

This collaborative approach enables Sars to gain access to a comprehensive dataset, facilitating more robust evaluations of taxpayers' financial activities.
