The Brooklyn Public Central Library held its annual BKLYN Library Robotics League championship on Jan. 25.

The lobby of the Brooklyn Public Central Library's Central Library at Grand Army Plaza buzzed with budding engineers as they competed in the annual BKLYN Library Robotics League championship on Jan. 25.

This year's top honors went to the team Irving Hawks of the Washington Irving Library, who claimed the coveted 2023 champion title, beating more than a dozen teams from libraries across the borough.

Second and third place went to Clarendon and Kings Bay Libraries, respectively. All three teams will advance to a citywide tournament later this year.

This year's theme, "Unearthed," challenged participants to prepare months in advance in collaboration with NYC FIRST, an organization that empowers students from diverse communities across New York City to engage with STEM and robotics.

Using LEGO SPIKE robotics and creative problem-solving, participants aged 9 to 17 built robots to remove topsoil and uncover hidden treasures, excavate heavy objects, recover artifacts, and reconstruct statues and other structures. Along the way, they learned valuable communication skills, including teamwork, conflict resolution, respect, and empathy.

The library system, which houses five teen tech centers at Kings Highway, Saratoga, Adams Street, Crown Heights, and Bay Ridge Libraries, offers the BKLYN Robotics League as part of a broader suite of programs. Patrons of all ages can explore science and technology through programs such as T4, a technology internship for teens; free computer basics courses; and advanced workshops in motion graphics, audio editing, 3D printing, AI, and more.

BPL President and CEO Linda Johnson thanked the parents, volunteers, librarians, and staff who helped the teams thrive, praising the "inventive" participants.

"The BKLYN Robotics League provides children and teens the opportunity to not only learn about building and programming robots, but also ...
