What to Know: Waymo crosses the pond

On Wednesday night, I went to a press event in London hosted by the Google-owned robotaxi firm Waymo, which announced it was aiming to make driverless taxis available to Londoners by the fourth quarter of 2026.

Bellwether city -- Even though Waymos have been driving autonomously in a handful of U.S. cities for years now, it's worth paying attention to what's going on in London. If all goes to plan, it will be the first European city where Waymo launches. It may also be Waymo's first international launch, depending on how quickly Waymo can launch in Tokyo, where cars are currently in a testing phase. London is a bellwether, in other words, of how easy it will be for American autonomous vehicles to be ported to foreign environments -- and therefore, how quickly we can expect to see robotaxis take over the world. It'll be fruitful to return to this story in a year's time, to see whether Waymo has met its goal.

A new (old) world -- As a Londoner, I can tell you firsthand: this city is very different from its American cousins. It is not based on a grid. Instead, it is a culmination of about 2,000 years of haphazard building and rebuilding, with roads that can be winding and narrow. Jaywalking is legal here, and cycling is far more common. It has a much greater population density than many of the cities where Waymo currently operates, meaning your typical road is not just narrower, but busier too.

Quietly confident -- In spite of all that, Waymo is confident that its vehicles won't take too much coaxing to get used to London roads. The wealth of training data it has collected from 20 million rides so far, the company says, have taught the AI powering its cars to understand dynamic road situations and adapt in real...
