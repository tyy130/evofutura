South Korea Keeps Nuclear Expansion on Track

South Korea is proceeding with plans to build two new large nuclear reactors as outlined in its 11 Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand, which was finalized in early 2025. Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) has opened a bidding process for local governments to host the reactors, which would have a combined capacity of 2.8 gigawatts electric (GWe) and are slated for completion by 2038. KHNP plans to select the site by 2027 and obtain construction permits in the early 2030s in order to meet that timeline. While President Lee Jae-myung has opposed nuclear new builds, arguing that building new reactors is unrealistic given the long construction timelines, he has supported the continued use of reactors that are already online or under construction, of which there are three. From a US-South Korea partnership perspective, the decision to continue new nuclear construction matters as maintaining an active construction program reinforces South Korea's technical expertise, supply chain capacity, and credibility as a partner for joint nuclear projects and exports.

Russia Expands Its Use of Nuclear Robotics

Russia is accelerating the use of advanced robotics across its nuclear manufacturing and construction supply chains. Rosatom is deploying robots across 30 projects -- spanning transportation, welding, inspection, and control operations -- cutting approximately five hundred thousand standard work hours annually. These projects include the use of "welding robots" for nuclear power plant heat transfer and pumping equipment, both of which are estimated to have cut work times roughly in half. Russia also launched a spider robot in 2025 for ultrasonic inspection of reactor and steam generator welds. Beyond productivity gains, Rosatom says that robotics frees skilled workers for higher-value tasks wh...
