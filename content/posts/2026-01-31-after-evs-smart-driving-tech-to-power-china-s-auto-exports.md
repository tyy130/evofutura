title: After EVs, smart driving tech to power China's auto exports

China exported a record 7.1 million cars in 2025, buoyed by growing demand for new-energy vehicles (NEVs) as the global shift toward electrification gathered pace, allowing the country to keep its position as the world's largest auto exporter.

As NEVs become more widespread, industry insiders and analysts are pointing to autonomous driving as the next driver of auto export growth, with rising interest from overseas consumers in the technology many believe could reshape driving habits.

European consumers expect autonomous vehicles to account for a quarter of total auto sales in Europe by 2035, said Guan Mingyu, managing partner of McKinsey & Co Inc's Beijing office, citing a survey. This bodes well for Chinese automakers and smart car technology providers looking to expand their global influence.

Chinese NEV-makers are at the forefront of smart car technology development, with companies such as XPeng Inc and Nio Inc already building an overseas presence with vehicles equipped with Level 2 assisted driving capabilities. Some Chinese self-driving system developers have also forged partnerships with established foreign auto-parts makers to help navigate local regulations.

Many foreign governments have introduced stringent rules targeting smart vehicles -- spanning data security, road safety and export controls -- that could prove troublesome for Chinese firms.

Smart vehicles need to collect various types of data to train their driver assistance systems, raising the bar for Chinese carmakers doing business in foreign countries, where data security, data storage and cross-border data transfer are top concerns of local regulators, said Chang Yanning, a smart car expert at the China Automotive Standardization Research Institute.

Overseas demand takes shape

An S&P Global Mobility survey of 8,000 consumers in eight countries including Brazil, Germany, Japan and the US found that over half of the respondents had some level of understanding of driver assistance technolog...
