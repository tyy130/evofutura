Rising adoption of generative AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic directly affects the major cloud computing platforms.

Over the last three years, OpenAI and Anthropic have evolved from speculative artificial intelligence (AI) laboratories into full-blown infrastructure behemoths. Between the two companies, trillions of dollars have been committed to future infrastructure projects.

Whether it's Project Stargate or new chip deals with Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices, OpenAI and Anthropic are on a mission to become the default platforms on which all things AI are built.

The benefit for Microsoft was that the company essentially purchased a first-mover advantage in integrating generative AI. Today, ChatGPT is heavily distributed throughout Microsoft's cloud service, Azure.

Whether it's coding on GitHub, data analytics through Dynamics, or generic prompts on Copilot, the increasing use of OpenAI's software has fueled a surge in the volume of AI workloads powered by Azure. Moreover, enterprises constantly need incremental cloud services -- which ultimately points them to Microsoft.

Through its partnership with OpenAI, Microsoft has become one of the strongest pillars supporting the AI revolution. This creates a flywheel effect between OpenAI and Azure -- ultimately making OpenAI's adoption a key tailwind for Azure's long-term trajectory.
