title: AI helps doctors detect more breast cancer cases in landmark trial
---

Artificial intelligence helps doctors spot more cases of breast cancer when reading routine scans, a world-first trial found on Friday.

The results suggest countries should roll out programmes taking advantage of AI's scanning power to ease the workload of short-staffed radiologists, the Swedish lead researchers said.

Well before the release of ChatGPT in 2022 raised global awareness about AI, scientists had been testing out the technology's capacity to read medical scans.

But the new study published in The Lancet medical journal marks the first completed randomised controlled trial -- the gold standard for this kind of research -- looking at AI-supported breast cancer screening.

The trial involved more than 100,000 women who received routine breast cancer scans across Sweden in 2021 and 2022.

They were randomly sorted into two groups. In one, a single radiologist was assisted by an AI system to check the scans.

The other followed the standard European method, which requires two radiologists to read the scans.

Nine percent more cancer cases were spotted in the AI group compared to the control group.

Over the following two years, those in the AI group also had a 12 percent lower rate of being diagnosed with cancer between routine scans, which are known as interval cancers and can be particularly dangerous.

The improvement was consistent across different ages and levels of breast density, which can be risk factors. The rate of false positives was similar in both groups.

Senior study author Kristina Lang of Sweden's Lund University said that "widely rolling out AI-supported mammography in breast cancer screening programmes could help reduce workload pressures amongst radiologists, as well as helping to detect more cancers at an early stage".

But this must be done "cautiously" and with "continuous monitoring", she said in a statement.

Jean-Philippe Masson, head of the French National Federation of Radiologists, told AFP that "the radiologist's eye and experi...
