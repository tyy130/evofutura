title: 'Artificial intelligence-enabled clinical decision support systems in preadmission
  testing: a scoping review of risk prediction, triage, and perioperative workflows

Despite this rapid expansion, several limitations persist. Most AI-enabled CDSS remain at the proof-of-concept stage, with retrospective, single-center data dominating the literature. External validation, interpretability, and integration into PAT clinical workflows are rare. Importantly, the practical value of AI-enabled CDSS will differ across health systems: settings without stable electronic health records, reliable connectivity, or analytic support -- in particular many low- and middle-income or financially constrained hospitals -- may struggle to implement complex algorithms within their clinical information systems, risking a widening digital divide in perioperative care. This scoping review therefore aims to synthesize evidence from 2020 to 2025 on AI-enabled CDSS for preoperative assessment and risk stratification within PAT, map dominant approaches, highlight gaps in implementation, and identify opportunities for translation into routine perioperative care. We therefore focus on AI-enabled CDSS that inform preadmission decision-making and perioperative workflows in PAT. We include AI-CDSS evaluated within preadmission testing or preoperative evaluation clinics (PAT-embedded) and tools developed outside PAT but whose outputs directly inform preoperative risk stratification, triage, test stewardship, or planning (PAT-informative). The review protocol was preregistered on the Open Science Framework under a broader 'digital determinants of health' umbrella, and the scope was refined -- prior to full data extraction -- to concentrate on AI-enabled CDSS for feasibility and depth (see Methods for details).

This scoping review followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines to ensure methodological rigor and transparency. The protocol was registered a priori with the Open Science Framework (OSF; DOI: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/JKCRH). The original registration described a b...
