title: 'Da Vinci platform robotic adrenalectomy for adrenal neoplasms: a GRADE-assessed
  systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective randomized trials comparing perioperative,
  postoperative, and economic outcomes with laparoscopic adrenalectomy - Journal of
  Robotic Surgery'

Robot-assisted adrenalectomy using the da Vinci platform offers theoretical advantages over conventional laparoscopy, including enhanced visualization, superior instrument articulation, and improved ergonomics. However, their comparative effectiveness remains controversial, with previous meta-analyses confounded by the inclusion of retrospective cohort studies. No systematic synthesis has exclusively evaluated prospective randomized controlled trials with formal GRADE certainty assessments. To compare the perioperative, postoperative, and economic outcomes of da Vinci robotic versus laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal neoplasms through GRADE-assessed meta-analysis restricted to prospective randomized trials. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD420251276037) on December 27, 2025. A systematic literature search (inception to December 2025) was performed to identify prospective randomized trials comparing robotic and laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Two independent reviewers performed the screening, extraction, and Cochrane RoB 2. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool operative time, blood loss, conversion, length of stay, complications, and cost. Heterogeneity was assessed using I² with pre-specified sensitivity and subgroup analyses. The GRADE system was used to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. Three randomized trials (n = 214 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Robotic adrenalectomy showed no statistically significant difference compared with laparoscopy in terms of operative time (MD 14.88 min, 95% CI - 25.18 to 54.95; P = 0.47; I²=94%; very low certainty), hospital stay (MD 0.04 days, 95% CI - 0.29 to 0.38; P = 0.80; I²=0%; low certainty), conversion rates (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.05 to 10.58; P = 0.81; I²=60%; very low certainty), postoperative complications (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.36; P = 0.30; I²=0%; low certainty), or total costs (MD $2444.02, 95% CI -$906.62 to 5794.66; P = 0.15; I²=99%; very low certainty)...
