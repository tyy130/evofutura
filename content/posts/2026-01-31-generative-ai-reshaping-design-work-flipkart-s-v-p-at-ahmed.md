title: 'Generative AI reshaping design work: Flipkart''s V-P at Ahmedabad Design Week'

GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL Intelligence (AI) is altering how design work is organised, who does it, and which skills will matter in the coming years, Gaurav Mathur, Vice President of Design at Flipkart, said during a keynote address at Ahmedabad Design Week on Saturday. He called the shift comparable to earlier platform transitions such as smartphones and cloud computing. "We are coming out of the smartphone era," Mathur said. "We are entering the generative era."

Mathur said the impact of generative AI on design would be shaped less by novelty and more by access. Unlike earlier forms of computational or generative design that required specialised tools, today's systems are widely available. "All of you have access to generative AI today inside your browser," he said.

He also explains how the cost of creation dropping sharply plays a role. "To create an image using generative AI, it costs less than one rupee," Mathur said. He described this change as "a huge disruption" to established creative workflows and production models.

Rather than positioning AI as a replacement for human designers, Mathur said the technology was changing how work is distributed. "What is happening today is that we are co-creating with machines," he said. "There is human creativity and machine intelligence coming together."

That shift is already visible inside large technology organisations from his perspective. Product development teams have traditionally been built around clearly defined roles. Designers, engineers, and product managers worked in coordination but within fixed boundaries. Generative AI is beginning to blur those lines according to Mathur. "A product manager can also design. A designer can also write code. An engineer can also design," he said. While the outputs may not always be perfect, the direction of change was clear. "What is essentially happening is that the boundaries are changing," he said.

As a result, future workplaces would rely less on rigid job titles. Rather, t...
