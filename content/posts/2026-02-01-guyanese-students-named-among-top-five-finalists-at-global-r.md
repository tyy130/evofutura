Guyanese students named among top five finalists at global robotics competition in Malaysia

Feb 01, 2026 News

(Kaieteur News) - A group of Guyanese students representing Camille's Academy have been named among the top five finalists at the Global Robotics Competition, Robowunder, held in Malaysia.

Camille's Academy placed fifth out of 30 shortlisted teams at competition, held on January 24, 2026, for their project titled the Automatic Fire Detection Intelligence System (AFDIS).

Team developer and engineer, Sherisa Khan explained that AFDIS is designed with AI assistance to help identify and prevent dangerous forest fires. She said the team decided to create an original prototype to help protect Guyana's forest in the face of climate change risks.

Khan explained "We all know that Guyana is made up 85 percent forest and as we know we are at serious risk of global warming. To help create a solution to combat the effects of global warming like dangerous forest fires, we have designed AFDIS which is our phase 1 prototype to detect the slightest amount of carbon monoxide, humidity like how dry or wet the atmosphere in the forest is and if it is in danger of a fire being started."

The team developer said that the programme is engineered by an edge AI algorithm to help detect a fire being started within a 500-mile radius.

"The minute the algorithm detects a threshold of 65 percent it sends a sms straight to the forest ranger's phone that 'hey, there is a risk of a fire being started at this exact location,'" she said.

She explained that another useful component of AFDIS is that it is built to make system failure or default reports.

"The system is completely self-reliant. So, if for any reason the equipment is damaged or malfunctions, the system is designed to report those problems. It will notify the ranger that 'hey a sensor is damaged here or there.'"

Khan explained to that unlike other forest fire detection devices that use satellite technology, AFDIS is relian...
