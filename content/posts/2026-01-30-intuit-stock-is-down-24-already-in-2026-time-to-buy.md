title: Intuit Stock Is Down 24% Already In 2026. Time to Buy?
---

Intuit is still guiding for double-digit growth in fiscal 2026, but at a meaningfully slower rate than last year.

Intuit (INTU 1.07%) stock has fallen sharply so far in 2026, despite reporting a solid fiscal first quarter in November and reiterating its full-year outlook for double-digit revenue and earnings growth.

A disappointing outlook, or not?

When the company reported its fiscal first-quarter results, Intuit reiterated its full-year guidance for fiscal 2026, with a range implying revenue growth of 12% to 13% year over year.
