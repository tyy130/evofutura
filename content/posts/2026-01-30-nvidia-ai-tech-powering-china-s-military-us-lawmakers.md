Last year, a low-cost generative AI model from China's DeepSeek, on par with US rivals, upended assumptions of American dominance in the fast-moving field.

The committee's letter, dated Wednesday, said Nvidia had treated DeepSeek "as a legitimate commercial partner deserving of standard technical support."

But DeepSeek routes Americans' data to the Chinese government "through infrastructure tied to a US-designated Chinese military company," it said.
