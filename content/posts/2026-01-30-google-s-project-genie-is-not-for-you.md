Google has a whole new world for people to play inâ€"but only for a minute. This week, the company released Project Genie, which the company calls its "general-purpose world model" that is capable of generating interactive environments. First unveiled to a small group of invite-only testers back in August of last year, the model, known as Genie 3, is now rolling out to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US, so you can get your hands on it for the low, low price of $250 per month.

The fact that Google is showing off a world model is interesting on its own. Unlike a large language model (LLM), the underlying technology that powers most consumer-facing AI tools including Google's own Gemini, which use the vast amount of training data they are given to predict the most likely next part of a sequence, world models are trained on the dynamics of the real world, including physics and spatial properties, to create a simulation of how physical environments operate.

World models are the approach to AI favored by Yann LeCun, the former chief scientist of Meta AI. LeCun believes (probably correctly) that LLMs will never be able to achieve artificial general intelligence, the point at which AI is able to match or exceed human capabilities across all domains. Instead, he believes world models can chart a path to that end goal, and he's recently joined a startup that is going all in on that bet. It's an oversimplification, but the idea is essentially that LLMs can only recognize patterns, whereas world models would allow AI to run tons of simulations to understand how the world works and extrapolate new conclusions.

Google playing in this world certainly provides some legitimacy to the idea that world models offer something that LLMs can't, and there is no denying that the preview videos that have come out of the Project Genie's early days are quite visually impressive, albeit short. Google is capping users at generating 60 seconds worth of their world, which the company also s...
