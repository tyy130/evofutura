Research activities at DataSci focus on developing data science/machine learning (ML) methods focusing on multimodal learning, knowledge-guided ML and interpretable pattern discovery as well as their applications in various fields, in particular, in (multimodal & longitudinal) omics and neuroimaging data analysis. The group has strong expertise in tensor decompositions, which lie at the heart of AI. DataSci develops models and algorithms, and releases open-access toolboxes pushing the state-of-the-art in data science in terms of multimodal learning and interpretable pattern discovery. The group has a wide network of collaborators and has access to unique data and research challenges provided by clinical partners. We are looking for a PhD student who will be part of this interdisciplinary and international research environment, and share our passion to develop impactful data science methods pushing the frontiers in multiple disciplines.

This PhD project will focus on multimodal learning. Data sets from diverse sources are collected in many applications to have a better understanding of complex systems such as the human brain, human metabolome, or to detect early risk factors for various diseases. For instance, to detect early life ...
