title: NASA's Perseverance Rover Completes First AI-Planned Drive on Mars
---

The team for the six-wheeled scientist used a vision-capable AI to create a safe route over the Red Planet's surface without the input of human route planners.

NASA's Perseverance Mars rover has completed the first drives on another world that were planned by artificial intelligence. Executed on Dec. 8 and 10, and led by the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, the demonstration used generative AI to create waypoints for Perseverance, a complex decision-making task typically performed manually by the mission's human rover planners.

"This demonstration shows how far our capabilities have advanced and broadens how we will explore other worlds," said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. "Autonomous technologies like this can help missions to operate more efficiently, respond to challenging terrain, and increase science return as distance from Earth grows. It's a strong example of teams applying new technology carefully and responsibly in real operations."

This animation was created using data acquired during Perseverance's Dec. 10, 2025, drive on Jezero Crater's rim. Pale blue lines depict the track the rover's wheels take. Black lines snaking out in front of the rover show the path options the rover is considering. The white terrain is a height map based on rover data. The blue circle that appears near the end of the animation is a waypoint.

During the demonstration, the team leveraged a type of generative AI called vision-language models to analyze existing data from JPL's surface mission dataset. The AI used the same imagery and data that human planners rely on to generate waypoints -- fixed locations where the rover takes up a new set of instructions -- so that Perseverance could safely navigate the challenging Martian terrain.

The initiative was led out of JPL's Rover Operations Center (ROC) in collaboration with Anthropic, using the company's Claude AI models.
