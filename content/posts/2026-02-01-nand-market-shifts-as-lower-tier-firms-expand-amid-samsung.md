title: NAND Market Shifts as Lower-Tier Firms Expand Amid Samsung, SK Hynix Focus
  on DRAM

AI-driven demand and reduced NAND production fuel price surge, market share competition

NAND flash inventory, which had been in oversupply until the first half of last year, has rapidly decreased, causing prices to surge sharply. This is the result of existing NAND leaders Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix focusing on DRAM products such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) amid growing AI demand, leading to reduced NAND production. The semiconductor industry assesses that as the "spring of NAND" arrives, lower-tier manufacturers are aggressively investing to target the gaps left by Samsung and SK, potentially causing a seismic shift in the NAND market.

According to market research firm DRAMeXchange on the 30th, the average fixed transaction price of 128Gb, gigabytes, multi-level cell (MLC) NAND universal products for memory cards and USBs in January was recorded at $9.46. This represents a sharp 64.83% increase from the previous month. Prices for other capacity NAND products also rose by over 50% each. Consequently, this year's global NAND market sales are expected to reach $147.3 billion (approximately 214 trillion Korean won), an 112% increase compared to the same period last year.

The rise in NAND prices is analyzed not merely as a result of supply shortages but as a qualitative shift driven by AI demand. As AI evolves, it requires continuously storing vast amounts of learning data and analysis results, and NAND serves as the non-volatile permanent storage solution. Particularly, recent AI services often need to extract specific results from vast datasets such as specialized knowledge or corporate documents, making NAND an essential product for storing such knowledge. Consequently, the semiconductor industry forecasts that the NAND product boom will continue for the next 2-3 years.

Unlike the DRAM market, which has solidified into a "three-power structure" led by Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Micron, the NAND market has many competitors and is relatively fluid....
