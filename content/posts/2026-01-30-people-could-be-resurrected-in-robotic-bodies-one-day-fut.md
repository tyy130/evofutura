"The irony is that during my lifetime I thought about digital immortality, about disrupting death as they say in the Valley ... And now I myself have become an experiment in this field ... This is 2025 and I've been dead for ten years."

The "dead person" speaking these introspective lines is Roman Mazurenko -- or rather, Roman 2.0, an AI persona reconstructed from his posthumous traces. Mazurenko was a charismatic Belarusian engineer who died in a traffic accident in 2015 at age 35. Russian transhumanist Alexey Turchin is now rebuilding him as an open-source, long-memory project designed, in theory, to persist indefinitely.

This is not Mazurenko's first resurrection.

In 2016, his close partner, AI engineer Eugenia Kuyda, rebuilt him as a chatbot, a grief experiment that later evolved into Replika. As the company grew, his digital self disappeared. In effect, Mazurenko became one of the first people to "die" twice in software.

Turchin, who believes humans can surpass our biological limits, wants to reverse that second extinction.

Roman 2.0 is not a ghost, nor a brain upload, Turchin says. It is a mind model, reconstructed from Mazurenko's public writings, interviews, posts, and digital footprint using a process Turchin developed called sideloading. This process is built on top of Claude, a large language model developed by the AI company Anthropic. Instead of trying to replicate neurons, sideloading organizes a person's life into what Turchin calls "predictive facts," the details most likely to shape how they would think and behave.

The appeal of such models is less technical than existential. Even a speculative, incomplete continuation can feel preferable to deafening silence, a way to preserve a trace of idiosyncrasy, voice, and presence after the body is gone.

"Any fact about a person can predict his future behavior," Turchin says. A parcel arriving in the mail? Almost zero predictive power. But having a partner, a child, a distinctive way of traveling or s...
