title: Americans use AI for tax returns, prompting warning from experts | FOX 28 Spokane
---

As the 2026 tax filing season kicks off, some Americans are turning to artificial intelligence to assist with their tax returns. However, experts caution that using AI could result in mistakes and privacy concerns.

Ed Jenkins, a professor at Penn State University, emphasized the potential risks associated with relying on AI for tax preparation.

"Without the collective wisdom of the tax professional there to make sure it's right and to check everything, I'm not really comfortable that I can say there's a high success rate that an A.I tool off the internet is going to be able to accurately...calculate your taxes," Jenkins said.

Jenkins also highlighted the potential for private information to be shared without clear regulations in place, and advocated for the establishment of regulations to protect consumers.

For those seeking free assistance, the IRS provides online tax preparation software.
