Medtronic is a diversified medical device company that's expanding its surgical robotic capabilities.

Investors remain extremely upbeat about the outlook for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, despite fears of an AI bubble. The likely reason is the expectation that these complex computer programs will creep into all aspects of life. It is already happening, but there are still plenty of things AI isn't doing that it probably could. One of those things is performing surgery.

In other words, AI is already in the mix.
