title: Rewiring climate modeling with machine learning emulators
---

The emergence of ML emulators is a methodological and structural shift that compels scientists to rethink what models are, how they are used, and who can run experiments with them. The full potential of emulators will be achieved not just through technical advancement, but through the intentional co-design of simulators, emulators, and observations, the democratization and standardization of data, and the improvement of emulator software for integration into workflows across disciplines.

Emulators, combined with the long-standing challenges in climate modeling, present an opportunity to reimagine the design, development, and deployment of climate models. We outline three key developments soon to be essential for climate modeling in the AI era: (1) the co-design of simulators and emulators as part of an integrated modeling ecosystem, (2) the development of shared data infrastructure and standardized benchmarks to support reproducibility and scalability, and (3) the software improvements for deeper integration of emulators into core scientific workflows, enabling interactive and decision-relevant climate analysis. Each of the three shifts will accelerate and advance discovery in climate science through interoperability, transparency, and collaboration across disciplinary boundaries.

Simulator and emulator co-design

As emulators and simulators improve, there is ample opportunity for strategic coordination and shared design. Today, emulators and simulators are often developed independently, advancing in parallel toward the same broad goals. While these separate efforts have enabled progress within each domain, they miss opportunities to accelerate insight. Emulators rely on simulation outputs for model training, and simulators can benefit from the rapid experimentation, uncertainty quantification for comparison to observations, complementary data assimilation approaches, integration with new ML-based analysis tools, and scenario analysis that emulators can provide.
