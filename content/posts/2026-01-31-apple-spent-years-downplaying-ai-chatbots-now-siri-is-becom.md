Send Help is a gonzo survivalist riff that works as well as it does because it features two incredibly game actors that surf the wave of Sam Raimi's tonal madness with a blend of absolute glee and carefully honed skill.

In an interview just last year, Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, said the company never wanted to send users "off into some chat experience in order to get things done.

There's a reason ChatGPT is the fastest-growing app ever.According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple plans to rebuild Siri into a full-fledged, system-wide AI chatbot later this year. Internally code-named Campos, the new Siri will replace the existing interface and be deeply embedded across iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems. Users will still summon it the same way - by saying "Siri" or holding a side button - but the experience after that will look far more like ChatGPT than the assistant Apple has spent the last decade downplaying.

Siri existed, but it was never positioned as the primary way people interacted with their devices. Mostly, that's because Siri wasn't very good. Yes, it would set reminders and start timers, but it has been pretty bad at almost everything else for a while now. Conversational AI, meanwhile, was framed as inelegant and inefficient.
