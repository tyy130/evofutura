At GMO, we have always defined a bubble as a two-standard deviation divergence of the price of any asset class above its long-term real price trend. The U.S. stock market has now been in bubble territory for a prolonged period. Sooner or later, the bubble will burst and the price will return to its historic level.

In our study of over 300 two-sigma bubbles across all asset classes for which we had good history, we identified a few genuine paradigm shifts in resources (why wouldn't there be, since all are finite?) including in oil after 1970, as well as in developing markets, such as India, as their economies became more capitalist. But in large developed equity markets, two-sigma bubbles had always broken and retreated all the way to the pre-existing trend. We saw this play out in the U.S. equity market in 1929, 1972, and 2000, and in the U.S. housing market (a three-sigma bubble, the largest in any important U.S. asset class) in 2006.

Yes, there was a handsome bear market in 2022 right on cue (-25% in the S&P 500, -35% in growth stocks, and almost -50% in the Magnificent 7), but this quite painful bear market was nipped in the bud, so to speak, by the introduction of ChatGPT in December 2022.

AI is a fast-moving and awe-inspiring invention that seems highly consequential -- even world-changing -- to almost everybody, myself included. It had an effect on what was then a deflating market of something like a multi-stage rocket. The rule from history is that great technological innovations lead to great bubbles. Especially when the technology is so o...
