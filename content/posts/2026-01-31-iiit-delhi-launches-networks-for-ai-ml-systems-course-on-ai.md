title: IIIT Delhi Launches Networks for AI/ML Systems Course on AI Fabrics and Systems
---

The Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT Delhi) has launched an advanced academic course titled "Networks for AI/ML Systems" focusing on AI fabrics and systems; a specialised area where networking, memory hierarchies and distributed execution impact the performance of large-scale artificial intelligence and machine learning infrastructure.

The programme has been introduced in collaboration with the Indian affiliate of Marvell Technology, Inc., with contributions from industry practitioners and ongoing mentoring from technical experts.

About the Course

* Title: Networks for AI/ML Systems

* Institution: IIIT Delhi

* Partner: Indian affiliate of Marvell Technology, Inc.

* Focus: AI networking fabrics, memory systems, distributed execution and high-performance machine-learning infrastructure

The course is designed to train students on aspects of AI system design and performance optimisation that are rarely covered in traditional AI/ML programmes. It emphasises the systems layer of modern AI, including how data movement, memory hierarchies and network fabrics influence large-scale performance and scalability.

Industry-Academia Collaboration

The new programme is co-designed and co-taught by faculty from IIIT Delhi and industry experts:

* Dr. Rinku Shah - Faculty, IIIT Delhi

* Abed Mohammad Kamaluddin - Director, Marvell Technology (Indian affiliate)

* Marvell engineers and architects; Technical mentors for the course

This collaboration reflects a growing trend in Indian tech education where academic institutions and industry partners jointly develop specialised courses, combining foundational knowledge with real-world systems experience.

Why It Matters

Experts at IIIT Delhi describe the programme as one of the first of its kind in India and possibly globally. By integrating AI networking, CXL-based memory systems, AI-scale simulation and distributed training insights, the course aims to fill a gap in existing AI/ML curricula that typ...
