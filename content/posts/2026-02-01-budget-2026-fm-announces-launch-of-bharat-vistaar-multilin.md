Sitharaman said the platform will use AI to contextualise crop, soil, weather and farm-practice data.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting Union Budget 2026, announced the launch of Bharat Vistaar (Virtually Integrated System To Access Agricultural Resources). It is a multilingual AI-driven agricultural tool aimed at improving farm productivity and reducing risk for farmers.

The Budget 2026 speech marked Sitharaman's ninth consecutive presentation, during which she positioned Bharat Vistaar as a platform to strengthen last-mile delivery of agricultural knowledge.

Platform For Last-Mile Farm Advisories

Bharat Vistaar will function as a single interface through which farmers can access verified and region-specific advisories in multiple Indian languages.

The tool is expected to integrate the government's Agri Stack portal with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and its package of practices, allowing farmers to draw on research-backed guidance in a more accessible format.

Using AI To Make Scientific Inputs Actionable

Sitharaman said the platform will use AI to contextualise crop, soil, weather and farm-practice data, helping convert scientific inputs into practical, on-ground decisions for farmers. By combining digital farmer records under Agri Stack with ICAR's recommendations, the initiative is intended to support more informed decision-making at the farm level.

The Budget 2026 speech also highlighted that the platform is meant to encourage wider adoption of best practices across diverse agro-climatic zones.

With its focus on verified advisories and region-specific guidance, Bharat Vistaar is positioned as an initiative to strengthen access of agricultural knowledge to farmers, especially through language-friendly delivery.
