title: The Nordic Blueprint for Building A.I. Infrastructure at Scale
---

As hyperscalers race to build A.I. capacity, the Nordics offer a proven model for resilience, efficiency and sustainability.

The rapid rise of A.I. is reshaping global infrastructure demands, pushing data centers from around the world to scale at unprecedented speed to support increasingly compute-intensive workloads. What was once a steady expansion has become a sprint, driven by generative A.I., large language models and real-time inference applications that strain existing power, cooling and connectivity systems.

Over the past year alone, hyperscalers have announced some of the largest digital infrastructure projects on record. In the U.S., an OpenAI-Oracle-SoftBank Stargate project has outlined five new data centers, totaling roughly five gigawatts of capacity, as part of a multi-year, multibillion-dollar expansion to support next-generation A.I. models. And in India, Google is investing roughly $6 billion to develop an infrastructure hub in Visakhapatnam. But while data centers may appear to be proliferating everywhere, not all locations are equally suited to the demands of A.I.

A.I. workloads have highly specific requirements, and where infrastructure is built has a direct impact on time to market, total cost of ownership and environmental sustainability. As power constraints, permitting delays and grid congestion continue to slow new projects in major markets, the central challenge has shifted. The focus is no longer simply on building capacity, but on finding where capacity can be responsibly developed at scale.

The Nordic region, traditionally known for its mining, steel, pulp and paper production, has e...
