Abstract:

Detecting complex chemical odors and gas mixtures is essential for environmental safety, healthcare, and food quality control, yet traditional gas sensors often struggle with limited selectivity, sensor drift, and slow response. A new generation of photonic noses -- optical sensing systems inspired by the human sense of smell -- offers a transformative solution. By combining advanced optical sensing technologies with artificial intelligence, photonic noses can capture detailed chemical fingerprints and interpret them with high accuracy. These systems leverage light-matter interactions and machine learning algorithms to achieve fast, label-free, and highly sensitive detection of volatile compounds, paving the way for smarter, more reliable sensing platforms capable of operating in complex, real-world environments.

Conventional electronic noses rely on arrays of chemical sensors whose electrical responses are often affected by humidity, temperature fluctuations, and long-term drift. While these systems have found practical applications, their performance limitations become critical when detecting trace gases or complex mixtures. Optical sensing technologies, in contrast, offer inherent advantages such as higher sensitivity, better stability, and richer information content through spectral signals. However, interpreting these high-dimensional optical signals remains challenging, especially in dynamic or noisy environments. Based on these challenges, there is a pressing need to develop integrated sensing systems that combine optical detection with advanced data processing capabilities to enable accurate, real-time, and robust chemical analysis.

In a comprehensive review published (DOI: 10.1038/s41378-025-01058-3) in Microsystems & Nanoengineering in 2025, researchers from Northwestern Polytechnical University systematically examine the evolution of photonic nose technologies and their integration with artificial intelligence. The article analyzes how optica...
