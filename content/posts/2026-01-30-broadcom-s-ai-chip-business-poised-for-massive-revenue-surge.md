title: Broadcom's AI Chip Business Poised for Massive Revenue Surge, Analysts Say
---

A major Wall Street firm has issued a bullish upgrade for Broadcom, citing explosive growth projections for the company's custom artificial intelligence chip division. Wolfe Research shifted its rating on the semiconductor giant from "Peer Perform" to "Outperform," accompanied by a $400 price target.

The central thesis from Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso hinges on Broadcom's application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed for AI. The firm projects this segment will generate approximately $44 billion in revenue during 2026. Their outlook becomes even more ambitious for the following year, forecasting a leap to $78.4 billion in 2027 ASIC sales. This anticipated surge is attributed primarily to increased shipments of Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).

This move follows a similar bullish signal from Wells Fargo, which raised its own price target on Broadcom in early January, also pointing to the company's strengths in AI semiconductors.

Furthermore, management disclosed a substantial backlog of $162 billion in orders, with $73 billion expected to be recognized over the next six quarters.
