Theia Ventures, Eximius Join $1M Pre-Seed Round in EarthSync

Bengaluru-based cleantech startup EarthSync has raised $1 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Theia Ventures with participation from Eximius Ventures, fueling its AI platform for renewable energy planning and operations.

AI Backbone for India's Clean Energy Transition

Founded in 2024 by Rajat Singh and Mehul Kumar, EarthSync delivers unified intelligence integrating techno-economic modeling, regulatory data, real-time simulations, and AI to help IPPs, C&I consumers, and energy advisors assess pricing, policy impacts, and asset performance before capital commitment. The platform has already simulated 10 GW solar/wind capacity and 4 GWh battery storage through pilots supporting 200 MW+ project bids.

Capital Accelerates Global Scale

Proceeds strengthen EarthSync's forecasting engine, expand its project marketplace, and grow the team for international rollout, replacing Excel-based legacy tools with agile, cloud-first workflows. Theia Ventures' Priya Shah highlighted the proprietary AI stack disrupting conventional renewable planning, positioning EarthSync to power India's energy transition across data centers, manufacturing, and textiles.
