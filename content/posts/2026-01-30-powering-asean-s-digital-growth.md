title: POWERING ASEAN'S DIGITAL GROWTH
---

TM Global's upgrades at Klang Valley Data Centre and Iskandar Puteri Data Centre are designed to accommodate rising artificial intelligence and cloud workloads across Asean.

AS the digital economy accelerates, seamless connectivity is now the cornerstone of growth.

TM Global, Telekom Malaysia's (TM) domestic and international wholesale arm, is empowering Malaysia to become the digital gateway of Asean, linking businesses across the region and around the world.

Building a resilient digital backbone

TM Global operates one of Malaysia's most extensive digital infrastructures, combining nationwide fibre networks, 5G backhaul, submarine cables and hyperconnected data centres.

This end-to-end ecosystem enables telcos, cloud providers and hyperscalers to deliver high-speed, low-latency services that power cloud adoption, artificial intelligence (AI), streaming and industrial internet of things (IoT).

Beyond Malaysia, TM Global's reach spans 33 submarine cable systems across 275,000 km, connecting the nation to major digital hubs in Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the United States.

New investments into Asia United Gateway East (AUG EAST) and the Candle subsea cable systems, along with the newest, fifth international Cable Landing Station (CLS) in Morib, Selangor, and an upcoming one in Kuala Sedili, Johor, further strengthen Malaysia's role as a regional data hub.

Complementing this, TM Global continues to expand its border-to-border fibre connectivity and international subsea cable systems across Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, creating a seamless north-south digital corridor to strengthen the country's position as Asean's digital crossroads.

"Our goal is to anchor Malaysia at the heart of Asean's digital ecosystem," says TM Global executive vice president Khairul Liza Ibrahim.

"By expanding our subsea, terrestrial and core infrastructure assets, we enable global players to connect and scale with confidence."
