PersonaPlex-7B takes a different approach by handling perception and response at the same time, enabling far more fluid, real-time interaction.

January saw Google DeepMind make a flurry of high-profile moves across AI research and robotics. The lab formally unveiled AlphaGenome, an advanced AI designed to analyse long stretches of DNA ...
