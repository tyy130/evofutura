A US company has announced it will make its driverless private hire vehicles available to hire in London from next year

Driverless taxis are set to make their debut in London this year, with the American firm Waymo kickstarting this ultra-modern mode of transport in April. You might have seen one of the 24 Waymo vehicles roaming the streets of London, although they are presently still being driven by humans, in order to map the city.

It comes as part of the government's plan to amend the Automated Vehicles Act in the second half of this year to enable driverless taxis to operate in and around the capital, with a date for the change to be confirmed in due course.

Waymo is planning to pilot-test its vehicles in the spring, and wants to launch a fully- driverless taxi service in London by September. Waymo emphasised the safety record of the cars, saying they were significantly safer than human drivers, especially for pedestrians or cyclists. So, what is a Waymo driverless taxi? How does it work? And, what can we expect to see in the future?

Waymo is a subsidiary of Google's parent firm, Alphabet, and is an American autonomous driving technology company, which was responsible for developing the first self-driving Google project car in 2009.

A Waymo driverless taxi is an electric vehicle equipped with several on-board sensors that remove the need for human input from behind the steering wheel when in full operation. The taxis currently operate in various cities across the globe such as Tokyo, San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. Its purpose is to make taxis safer, more convenient and technologically advanced. They can operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

A Waymo driverless taxi uses a combination of cameras, radars, lidars and ultrasonic sensors. They're located all around the vehicle, while there is a computer positioned in the boot of the car that processes data, which can determine how the vehicle will react in real-life driving conditions.
