PUNE, INDIA -- As India prepares for the AI Impact Summit on February 19 and 20, the Indian government's pitch for wider adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has centered on the potential for the technology to benefit Indian society. As my colleague Trisha Ray wrote in November, India "appears to be taking a people-centered approach, emphasizing use cases that have the greatest scope for positive impact for the widest swath of the population."

During my time in Pune, a technology hub in Maharashtra, I spoke with local students, scientists, tech startup workers, and farmers. Though we met to talk about other topics, they consistently brought up AI and how they wished to take advantage of the technology. As I had more of these conversations, I found that to benefit the widest swath of the Indian population, the country should adopt a "sachet" approach to AI as a consumer product. The idea of applying the idea of sachets, or small packets used to package small consumer products, to AI is not new in India. But so far, this model has lacked proofs of concept and investment from the private sector, which has instead attempted to expand access by offering low-tier subscription models.

The sachet approach takes inspiration from the model that sparked India's consumer goods revolution of the 1980s. Prior to that, Indian consumer products such as shampoo, talcum powder, and hair oil were sold in quantities of 50 grams (g) to 500 g.

By the mid-1980s, this more affordable consumer model made a wide variety of products more accessible to broader swaths of the Indian population.

Currently in India, a monthly ChatGPT or Perplexity Pro subscription costs ₹1,999 ($22.17) and a monthly Google AI subscription costs ₹1950 ($21.62). AI companies do recognize the need for less expensive and more accessible options, as ...
