The two companies said the project was the first-ever plan to launch public-road trials of fully autonomous vehicles in the UK.

Dashcam footage showed Mr Kendall's car driving along Tottenham Court Road, then south through Soho and Trafalgar Square before reaching Buckingham Palace via Victoria Embankment and Parliament Square.
