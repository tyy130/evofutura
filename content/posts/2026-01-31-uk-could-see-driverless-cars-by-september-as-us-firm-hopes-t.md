Driverless cars are set to become a reality in Britain in just a few months. Waymo, a driverless car company based in the United States, has announced that driverless taxis could be operating in London as early as September, pending government approval of their plans.

Currently, the company has 24 vehicles navigating around the capital, but these cars are still being driven by humans at this stage of the process. This allows the cars to map the streets before being officially deployed.

If the Labour government approves new legislation permitting driverless cars in 2026, it would pave the way for Waymo to launch its services in the UK. This would make Waymo the first commercial driverless car service in the country.

The firm, which is owned by Google-parent Alphabet, showed off a fleet of cars it brought to the UK at London's Transport Museum on Wednesday. Tekedra Mawakana, the Waymo co-CEO, said she believes the company can "responsibly" operate driverless car services.

Mawakana said: "We're thrilled to bring the reliability, safety and magic of Waymo to Londoners. Waymo is making roads safer and transportation more accessible where we operate.

"We've demonstrated how to responsibly scale fully autonomous ride-hailing, and we can't wait to expand the benefits of our technology to the United Kingdom. "

Local Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood said: "We're supporting Waymo and other operators through our passenger pilots, and pro-innovation regulations to make self-driving cars a reality on British roads."

She added, "We know that unlike human drivers, automated vehicles don't get tired, don't get distracted and don't drive under the influence," she said.

But she clarified that autonomous vehicles also had to meet strict safety standards, "including protection from hacking and cyber threats," before they would be allowed on UK roads.
