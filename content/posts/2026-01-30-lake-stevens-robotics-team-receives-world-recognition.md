title: Lake Stevens robotics team receives world recognition
---

LAKE STEVENS -- Lake Stevens Robotics team 8931R, known as Arsenic, won second place in the skills portion of the VEX Robotics Competition in Bellingham on Jan. 17, earning them a fifth-place ranking in the world and fourth nationally.

A score so high that only earns them second place speaks to the "world-class" competition in Washington, Lakes Stevens Robotics coach Jeff Lynass said in an interview.

The VEX Robotics Competitions are designed by the Robotics Education and Competition Foundation and change every year. Robots are designed and programmed to fit each season's competition.

For the 2025-26 season, the main competition pairs two teams together, with one robot each, to go against two other teams. Each pair tries to keep its colored blocks in the scoring areas while pushing the other color out. Matches include both an autonomous period, with no human interaction, and a driver-controlled period.

There are also side competitions that test both the robot's autonomous ability and the driver's skills without other teams on the field. That's where Team Arsenic won second place -- in the skills competition -- at the ROBO-BASH 2026.

The skills competition awards points for blocks scored in various goals, blocks removed from certain areas, and finishing with the robot in the parking zone.

"It was just a huge relief, I think, more than excitement," team Arsenic member Chris Rapues, 17, said in an interview with the team.

Team Arsenic has four members, including Rapues. Corbin Kingston, 18, is the data analyst and project manager. Riley Walrod is the primary programmer and strategy analyst. Along with being the scout and a programmer, Colwyn Roberts puts together the notebook that explains all the decisions made throughout the process. Rapues is in charge of building and is the team's driver.

Rapues was confident he could earn a high score on the driving portion of the skills challenge. However, the team was unsure how the autonomous portion would go, he said.
