Investing.com -- Apple Inc. has lost at least four more artificial intelligence researchers in recent weeks, Bloomberg reported Friday.

The departing researchers include Yinfei Yang, who left to start a new company, while Haoxuan You and Bailin Wang joined Meta, the report said. You moved to Meta's Superintelligence research division, and Bailin Wang is now working on Meta's recommendations systems.

Meanwhile, researcher Zirui Wang has joined Google DeepMind, the same company that is helping Apple build core AI models for new features, including technology for an upgraded version of Siri launching this year.

In another development, Stuart Bowers, a senior executive working on Siri, has also left for Google DeepMind. Bowers had previously been a top leader on Apple's self-driving car project before becoming one of the managers tasked with improving the company's voice assistant. Last year, he received an expanded role focused on Siri's response capabilities, reporting to new Siri chief Mike Rockwell.

These exits highlight ongoing challenges within Apple's AI division as the company struggles to keep pace with competitors in the artificial intelligence field. The decision to outsource some technology to Alphabet Inc.'s Google has reportedly caused discontent among staff, contributing to what has become an exodus of talent, particularly from Apple's AI teams.
