Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of adjusting roadmap graphs for robot motion planning to non-static environments. We introduce the "Red-Green-Gray" paradigm, a modification of the SPITE method, capable of classifying the validity status of nodes and edges using cheap heuristic checks, allowing fast semi-lazy roadmap updates. Given a roadmap, we use simple computational geometry methods to approximate the swept volumes of robots and perform lazy collision checks, and label a subset of the edges as invalid (red), valid (green), or unknown (gray). We present preliminary experimental results comparing our method to the well-established technique of Leven and Hutchinson, and showing increased accuracy as well as the ability to correctly label edges as invalid while maintaining comparable update runtimes.
