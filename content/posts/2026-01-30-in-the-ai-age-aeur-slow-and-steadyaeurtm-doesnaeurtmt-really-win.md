title: In the AI age, â€~slow and steadyâ€™ doesnâ€™t really win

Every tech company right now is being judged on the delicate dance between industry transformation and business preservation. This week we got a better read on how CEOs are weighing risk against long-term ambition. Take Microsoft. For the first time ever, it posted a $50 billion quarter in cloud revenue, up $10 billion from a decade ago. But that growth wasnâ€™t good enough for Wall Street, and yesterdayâ€™s stock drop wiped out $357 billion in value, its steepest fall since 2020.

Sure, there are jitters about an AI bubble. But the real worry is that Microsoft isnâ€™t moving fast enough to blow up its own core services â€" namely, Office 365 â€" and turn them into some kind of magical AI experience (remember Bing chat?). If Microsoft cedes its grip on the corporate world, it becomes a data center and cloud services provider with thinner margins and a shallower moat.

And then thereâ€™s Meta, which said it would double AI infrastructure spend to $135 billion. Youâ€™d expect investors to freak out a little in the absence of a straightforward plan to make money on all that compute, but shareholders rewarded Meta with a 10% stock pop.

The most extreme version of managing through this paradox of change is Tesla. On Wednesday, Elon Musk said the company was ditching its iconic Model X and Model S cars to clear factory space for humanoid robots. He also said the company would funnel $2 billion from Teslaâ€™s balance sheet over to xAI.

Musk recognizes that making cars is a crappy business in the AI era, especially when China is willing to subsidize them and flood the market with cheap alternatives. Itâ€™s the on-board software that turns cars into revenue-generating robots that represents the value.

And once you realize youâ€™re a robotics company, it really makes no sense to waste time â€" or precious factory space â€" on a business that may soon be obsolete.

As Microsoft and Meta try ...
