A federal jury in San Francisco has delivered a verdict that lands at the center of the global AI race, the Department of Justice announced Friday.

On Thursday, jurors convicted a former Google software engineer of stealing sensitive AI trade secrets, marking the first U.S. conviction tied directly to artificial intelligence-related economic espionage. Prosecutors say the stolen material was meant to benefit the People's Republic of China, a charge that places the case squarely within rising tensions over who controls the future of advanced computing.

The defendant, 38-year-old Linwei Ding, who also went by Leon Ding, was found guilty on seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets, according to court documents. The charges stem from the alleged theft of thousands of pages of confidential Google information tied to its internal AI infrastructure.

"In today's high-stakes race to dominate the field of artificial intelligence, Linwei Ding betrayed both the U.S. and his employer by stealing trade secrets about Google's AI technology on behalf of China's government," said Roman Rozhavsky, assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence and Espionage Division, in a statement Friday. "Today's verdict affirms that federal law will be enforced to protect our nation's most valuable technologies and hold those who steal them accountable."
