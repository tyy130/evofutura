Let's go for my web review for the week 2026-05.

Neocities Is Blocked by Bing

Tags: tech, web, search, microsoft, vendor-lockin

Huh? What's going on there? I don't see why they would exclude this domain completely, it makes no sense.

The Enclosure feedback loop

Tags: tech, ai, machine-learning, gpt, copilot, enclosure, vendor-lockin

Interesting point. As we see the collapse of public forums due to the usage of AI chatbots, we're in fact witnessing a large enclosure movement. And it'll reinforce itself as the vendors are training on the chat sessions. What used to be in public will be hidden.

No, Cloudflare's Matrix server isn't an earnest project

This doesn't reflect well on both Cloudflare and the Matrix Foundation I'm afraid.

Microsoft Gave FBI BitLocker Encryption Keys, Exposing Privacy Flaw

Tags: tech, microsoft, security, privacy

Are we surprised? Of course not... As soon as you backup the keys on someone else's server BitLocker can't do anything to ensure privacy.
