title: Multimodal oscillator networks learn to solve a classification problem - npj
  Metamaterials

An open problem in physical learning is figuring out how to build physical systems where the learning occurs through the natural evolution of the material, instead of relying on manual updates or external electronic circuitry. Such material could potentially extend the parallelism and speed of wave computing to the learning process, enabling the use of physical phenomena to train machine learning models. However, realizing self-learning in metamaterials is a significant challenge. This is because a self-learning material is tasked with solving two simultaneous problems24: On one hand, the material performs a direct problem on the input signals. This direct problem can be, for example, solving a classification task. On the other hand, the material is also performing an inverse problem, autonomously adapting its parameters to improve its fitness in response to new examples.

In this work, we introduce a metamaterial model that learns from examples. The metamaterial, consisting of a network of coupled multimodal resonators, simultaneously solves both learning and inference problems using wave physics. When solving a classification task, the proposed metamaterial can be seen as a square lattice of masses and springs. The input is applied as a harmonic force in one or several sites. In a flower classification problem, this input may consist of the geometric features of the flower, such as petal width and petal length -- with higher amplitudes corresponding to larger feature values. The output of the computation is the vibration amplitude of a designated output site (Fig. 1a). Although spring networks (and mathematically analogous resistor networks) are relatively simple physical systems, they are able to solve classification and allostery tasks; when they are augmented with nonlinearity, they are in fact computationally universal. The learning process is based on the contrastive learning rule. In contrastive learning, two copies of the system are constructed. Both copies...
