title: 'Nvidia''s CEO Says the "ChatGPT Moment" for Physical AI Is Here: 1 Move to

At CES earlier this month, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia (NVDA 0.72%), unveiled his company's latest artificial intelligence (AI) models and semiconductor chips, declaring that "the ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here."

According to Huang, Nvidia's AI models for autonomous vehicles could finally make ubiquitous driverless cars a reality. He predicted that robotaxis would be among the first to benefit, as the world's first thinking, reasoning, autonomous AI -- Nvidia's Alpamayo technology -- hits the market.

Huang's demonstration of Alpamayo driving a car in San Francisco was impressive, yet Nvidia shares ticked downward slightly after the conference. This might seem puzzling, considering Nvidia's show of force in an emerging industry that is projected to total $13.6 trillion by 2030, according to Fortune Business Insights.

But there are two reasons why Wall Street may be skeptical.

In 2016, Tesla (TSLA +3.38%) CEO Elon Musk predicted that a Tesla would drive itself from Los Angeles to New York City with no human needed by 2017. A decade after the prediction, while Tesla's AI-assisted driving technology is called Full Self-Driving (Supervised), it requires constant vigilance from human drivers.

In 2019, Alphabet (GOOG 0.04%)(GOOGL 0.05%) joined Tesla in predicting that self-driving technology would grow exponentially by 2021. Yet while AI driver assistance is present in many vehicles, you can't buy a truly self-driving car today.

To be fair, there were many failed predictions about AI-related natural language processing software before the technology had a breakthrough moment in November 2022, with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The virtual assistant gained 100 million users in just two months. Chances are, you remember its immediate impact on markets. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite had its best first half of a year since 1983, while Nvidia stock went on to surge over 1,300%.

So whil...
