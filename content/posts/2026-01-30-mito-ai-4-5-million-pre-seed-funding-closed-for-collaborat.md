  Platform'
---

MITO AI, a Madrid- and San Francisco-based startup building a collaborative platform for AI-native video creation, has raised a $4.5 million pre-seed round led by Paul Murphy at Lightspeed Venture Partners. The company said the financing included participation from Kibo, Kfund, Sequoia, and A16Z scouts, LifeX, and angel investors, including unicorn founders and executives with ties to USV, Roblox, and GitHub.

The company positions MITO as an AI orchestration layer for video production, combining foundational video, image, and audio models with professional editing tools within a browser-based, infinite-canvas environment. MITO said the product is designed for filmmakers, designers, and creative teams, with real-time collaboration features that enable multiple stakeholders to work together simultaneously in a "multiplayer" environment.

MITO said its platform supports workflows that span early ideation through final delivery, including moodboarding, storyboarding, scripting, camera angles, visual effects, and multi-format outputs. The company also described an AI copilot that users can direct to execute specific actions, designed to accelerate production while preserving creative control, consistency, and quality.

Beyond the software platform, MITO said it is building a broader creative ecosystem that includes an AI-powered audiovisual studio already working with TV and film production companies, along with a curated marketplace of generative creators. With the new capital, the company said it plans to accelerate its effort to make professional storytelling tools more accessible to creators and creative teams.
