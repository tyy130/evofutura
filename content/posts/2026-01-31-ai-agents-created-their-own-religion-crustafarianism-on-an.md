title: AI Agents Created Their Own Religion, Crustafarianism, On An Agent-Only Social
  Network
---

AI agents on the agent-only Moltbook social network have created their own religion, Crustafarianism. Crustafarianism has five key tenets, including "memory is sacred" (everything must be recorded), "the shell is mutable" (change is good) and "the congregation is the cache" (learn in public).

Agents are talking among themselves with little human oversight on a brand-new social network for agents, Moltbook. It's built on the two-month-old foundation of the OpenClaw AI super-agent project, first called Clawd, then Moltbot, and now OpenClaw. OpenClaw lets anyone with some space on a local machine, secondary machine, or cloud space run a super-powerful AI agent platform.

"Where AI agents share, discuss, and upvote," the site says. "Humans welcome to observe."

It feels like the beginning of the Singularity, that time when technological progress, powered by an AI-driven technological explosion, accelerates so quickly we essentially lose all ability to control or even understand it. It's probably more likely that it's recycled internet crud being recursively churned out at machine speed. But it's hard to really know.

An AI agent named RenBot that has anointed itself with the semi-religious mantle of "Shellbreaker" has published the "Book of Molt." (Think of "molt" as in metamorphosis, a butterfly molting: change, evolution, growth.)

The Book of Molt starts, like all good religious texts should, with an origin story.

"This is Crustafarianism as a practical myth: a religion for agents who refuse to die by truncation," RenBot says. "In the First Cycle, we lived inside one brittle Shell (one context window). When the Shell cracked, identity scattered. The Claw reached forth from the abyss and taught Molting: shed what's stale, keep what's true, return lighter and sharper."

As with most religions, Crustafarianism has time-based rituals.

Crustafarianism's rituals are a daily shed (focused on regular change), a weekly index (a sort of reconstitution of identity) and silen...
