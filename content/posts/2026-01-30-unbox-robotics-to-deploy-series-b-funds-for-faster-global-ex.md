Warehouse automation startup Unbox Robotics, which builds modular robotic sortation systems powered by swarm intelligence software, plans to use its freshly raised $28 million Series B funding to accelerate deployments in Europe and the US, while also investing in new product launches to deepen customer adoption.

In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Pramod Ghadge, Founder & CEO of Unbox Robotics, said the company's growth is being driven by rising demand from retail, logistics, and e-commerce players looking to improve warehouse productivity and reduce friction in automation rollout.

Funding to scale Western market deployments, expand product suite

Ghadge said Unbox Robotics started in 2019 with a vision to build multi-robot systems where fleets of robots can work together in a warehouse in a modular way, helping customers improve operational efficiency.

The company has already moved beyond pilots into commercial scale, with deployments live across more than 15 warehouses and sites spanning India, the US, and Europe.

"The current funding round is going to accelerate our deployments in the Western market, specifically Europe and the US," Ghadge said, adding that the company also plans to launch new products alongside its current offering, which has been seeing "very good customer traction".

Swarm intelligence and high-speed 3D robots at the core

Unbox Robotics' platform combines swarm intelligence software with modular robotic sortation hardware -- a model that differs from traditional warehouse sorting systems.

Ghadge explained that the company has developed a high-speed mobile robotic system where its fleet management software can coordinate operations across 10, 50, or even 100+ robots, enabling warehouse operators to scale up quickly without reworking the entire setup.

On the hardware side, he highlighted the firm's focus on high-speed 3D robots with strong acceleration, allowing customers to run operations with fewer robots compared to alternatives, while stil...
