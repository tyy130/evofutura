title: 'Tesla''s $2 Billion xAI Bet Comes With A Big Pivot: Retiring Model S/X As
  Robots And AI Infrastructure Take Center Stage'

Tesla announced it is tightening the links between its automotive, energy, and artificial intelligence ambitions in a way few public companies have attempted: by investing directly into xAI while simultaneously reshaping its manufacturing roadmap around robotics. These moves, disclosed in SEC filings and earnings-call coverage, position Tesla less as a premium EV maker and more as a vertically integrated "physical AI" platform, spanning data centers, grid-scale batteries, humanoid robots, and autonomy.

Earlier this month, Tesla disclosed that it entered into an agreement on January 16, 2026, to invest approximately $2 billion in xAI's Series E Preferred Stock, citing a review consistent with the board's fiduciary duties and its related-party transactions policy.

The investment is notable not just for its size, but for what it signals: Tesla is treating xAI as strategically adjacent to its next growth pillars -- autonomous driving and robotics -- rather than as a separate Musk venture operating in parallel. Reuters also reported Tesla's $2 billion commitment as part of a broader market narrative about Elon Musk's companies becoming more interconnected as Tesla pushes deeper into AI and robotics.

At the same time, Tesla is moving to discontinue its long-running Model S and Model X flagship sedans and SUVs. Multiple reports linked the decision to a strategic pivot: Tesla plans to reallocate attention and factory space toward robotics, including its humanoid-robot program, rather than continuing low-volume, higher-priced vehicle lines.

Business Insider highlighted the underlying sales pressure: Tesla's "other models" category -- which includes Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck -- totaled 50,850 units in 2025, a small single-digit share of Tesla's total volume, underscoring why the company might view these vehicles as less central to its future than scalable AI-driven products.

Tesla's annual report also revealed an equally consequential operational linkage already i...
