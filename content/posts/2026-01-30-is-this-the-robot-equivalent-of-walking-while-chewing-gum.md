title: Is This the Robot Equivalent of Walking While Chewing Gum?
---

Westwood Robotics is proud to announce a major update: THEMIS Gen2.5, the world's first commercial full-size humanoid robot capable of manipulation on the move!

Now that you mention it, the bit at the end where the robot picks up a can while walking? I haven't seen a lot of that.

Last year, Helix showed that a single neural network could control a humanoid's upper body from pixels. Today, Helix 02 extends that control to the entire robot -- walking, manipulating, and balancing as one continuous system.

Why yes, I am a normal human and this is very similar to the default state of my kitchen.

Harry Goldstein, our Editor in Chief, went to meet Sprout from Fauna Robotics. He was skeptical at first, but Sprout won him over with its robotic charm.

Kimberly Elenberg is showing how the data collected by robotic responders can save lives in mass casualty events.

The educational robotics market is tough, but you've got to hand it to Sphero -- going strong since 2011, which is pretty incredible.

How do you remotely control robots that change shape? We introduce a method for user-guided control of modular robots using reconfigurable joint-space joysticks (JoJo) and real-time optimization. We demonstrate this system on two different robots, Mori3 and Roombots. The video shows examples of these robots performing object manipulation, locomotion, human-assistance, and reconfiguration, controlled by our system.
