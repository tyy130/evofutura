This update underscores how one of the UK's largest banking groups is moving beyond experimentation with AI and into large-scale deployment.

One bank is happy about the impact of AI.

Lloyds Banking Group has highlighted the growing financial and operational impact of AI as part of its financial results, revealing that generative AI delivered around £50 million ($68.7 million) of value in 2025, with more than £100 million ($137.4 million) in additional value expected in 2026 as the technology is scaled further across the organization.

We can expect job cuts as well, as that is usually a result of AI too.

Along with the AI boost, it reported profit before tax for 2025 of £6.7 billion ($9.2 billion), up from £6 billion ($8.2 billion) the year before.

According to the Group, the £50 million in value generated in 2025 reflects efficiencies, productivity gains, and service improvements driven by the rollout of more than 50 generative AI solutions across the business. These tools have been embedded into both customer-facing channels and internal operations, signalling a shift from pilot projects to enterprise-wide adoption.

The expectation of more than £100 million in additional value in 2026 reflects plans to expand not only generative AI, but also agentic AI systems that can take more autonomous actions, orchestrating tasks across multiple processes. For Lloyds, this scaling phase is expected to amplify returns by automating more complex workflows and enabling faster, more consistent decision-making.
