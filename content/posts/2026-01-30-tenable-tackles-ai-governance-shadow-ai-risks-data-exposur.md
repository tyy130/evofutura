title: Tenable Tackles AI Governance, Shadow AI Risks, Data Exposure
---

With adoption of AI tools among employees often outpacing the development of policies to manage their safe use, organizations are increasingly concerned about AI governance. Controlling the use of company data to train AI models and policing "shadow AI" are big concerns.

In response to these concerns, Tenable released Tenable One AI Exposure as part of its cloud-native Tenable One exposure management portfolio to detect, map, and govern the use of agentic and generative artificial intelligence (AI) platforms across all enterprise infrastructure, including cloud services and SaaS applications. The add-on, originally previewed last year, is designed to detect when employees use unsanctioned AI tools or engage in activities that pose a risk of data leakage. It also correlates the use of AI platforms, agents, libraries, and workflows with enterprise infrastructure, identity, and data, and is designed to enforce organization-wide policies governing AI usage.

While it is designed for all AI platforms, the initial rollout currently has deeper detection capabilities for Microsoft's Copilot and OpenAI's ChatGPT. A forthcoming update will provide broader support for Google's Gemini, with other key platforms to follow, says Tenable chief product officer Eric Doerr.

Extending Vulnerability Scanning to Find AI Usage

Since releasing a preview version of the AI exposure management capability last summer, Tenable has integrated its newly acquired Apex Security Platform, which gathers telemetry, performs behavioral analysis to enforce AI policies and governs the use of AI models. Tenable acquired Apex Technology last year, signaling it would integrate those capabilities into Tenable AI Aware, a capability added in 2024, designed to detect vulnerabilities in AI applications, libraries and plug-ins.

"Many of our customers are already using us for vulnerability scanning, and now we've extended those scanners so they're looking for the artifacts of AI usage across the estate," Doer...
