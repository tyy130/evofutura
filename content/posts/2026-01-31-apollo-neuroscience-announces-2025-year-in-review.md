Community Gains Nearly 144 Million Minutes of Sleep, Wins Best Sleep Wearable of 2025

NEW YORK, Jan. 30, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Apollo Neuroscience today released its 2025 Year in Review, revealing how daily nervous-system support translated into measurable improvements in sleep, stress regulation, focus, and recovery for its global community. In 2025 alone, Apollo users collectively gained 143,862,300 minutes of additional sleep, surpassing the company's audacious goal of giving the world back 100 million minutes of rest.

That milestone - equivalent to more than 273 years of human sleep restored in a single year - coincided with Apollo being recognized with two more industry awards, including SHE Media Flow Space Best Sleep Wearable of 2025, reinforcing the alignment between real-world outcomes and independent recognition.

"When you support the nervous system consistently and respectfully, people don't just feel better - they function better," said David Rabin, MD, PhD, psychiatrist, translational neuroscientist, and co-founder of Apollo Neuroscience. "What we saw in 2025 was millions of people quietly improving their health in ways that compound over time - and the data finally makes the significance of this impact clear."

A Year Defined by Measurable Impact

Apollo's 2025 data shows how small daily interventions scaled into population-level outcomes:

143,862,300 minutes of additional sleep gained18,989,179 automated sleep interventions preventing untimely wakeups1,059,874,292 mindful minutes

Over a year that adds up to more than 50 additional hours of sleep per person. Among Apollo's most engaged users, gains were substantially higher:

Top 25%: ~33 extra minutes per night (200 hours per year)Top 5%: ~46 extra minutes per night (280 hours per year)

"This is the difference between constantly running on empty and finally giving the body enough rest to repair itself to fend off illness and burnout," Dr. Rabin added.
