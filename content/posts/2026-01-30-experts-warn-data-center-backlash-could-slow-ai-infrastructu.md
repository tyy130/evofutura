title: Experts Warn Data Center Backlash Could Slow AI Infrastructure Growth - Decrypt

Authors warn unresolved local opposition could slow or block future AI infrastructure projects.

AI data centers are expanding rapidly across the U.S., but growing local resistance is emerging as a potential roadblock for the infrastructure behind artificial intelligence.

A new report from nonprofit think tank Brookings warns that disputes over electricity use, water consumption, tax abatements, and environmental impact are increasingly slowing or threatening data center projects. The authors say legally binding community benefit agreements are necessary to prevent local opposition from constraining AI infrastructure growth.

"Data centers are both controversial and critical to the artificial intelligence technologies undergirding the digital economy," the report said. "Without abundant data centers, the digital revolution could potentially stall, restricting access to the benefits of digital technologies for individuals, communities, governments, and businesses."

The report comes as demand for computing power ramps up and AI data centers spread nationwide, supported by the Trump administration. In January 2025, Trump announced Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative backed by OpenAI and Oracle, and called for long-term safeguards to ensure communities are not left with data centers that deliver little benefits.

According to Shaolei Ren, an associate professor of electrical engineering at the University of California, Riverside, local concerns about water use, public health, electricity costs, noise, and related issues are valid and should be addressed upfront before construction begins.

"Ultimately, the metric that really matters is community satisfaction, and that is what we should be optimizing for," Ren told Decrypt. "There is a growing recognition that community voices matter, and that data centers should be planned and built in alignment with local interests, not just technical or economic objectives."

"Of course, the first step is measureme...
