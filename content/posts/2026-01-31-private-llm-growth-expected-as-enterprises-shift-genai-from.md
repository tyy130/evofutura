LLM.co Expands Private, Custom LLM Offering as Enterprise AI Spending and Adoption Accelerate

Seattle, Washington, United States, January 31, 2026 -- Private, custom large language models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming core enterprise infrastructure as organizations push generative AI into production while seeking to retain control over sensitive data, intellectual property, and regulatory exposure.

According to Gartner, worldwide artificial intelligence spending is projected to reach $2.52 trillion in 2026, representing year-over-year growth of more than 40 percent, with enterprise infrastructure and custom deployments accounting for a significant share of new investment. Separately, International Data Corporation (IDC) estimates organizations will spend over $370 billion on generative AI implementation between 2024 and 2027, signaling a multi-year capital shift toward operational AI systems rather than experimental tools.

At the usage level, McKinsey & Company reports that more than 70 percent of organizations are now regularly using generative AI, up from roughly one-third just two years earlier -- placing growing pressure on companies to address data security, compliance, and performance reliability at scale.
