title: The GPU gap in Indias AI dream - The Tribune
---

India has entered its AI awakening, driven by talent, investment and a fast-modernising digital population. But the country's ambitions face an undeniable bottleneck: the near-total reliance on foreign-made Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and accelerators.

India's AI momentum is real, but it is also fragile. The country seems to be entering a rare convergence of talent, capital and policy intent. AI-first startups are emerging fast, global investors are paying attention and the government is also moving fast on deep-tech infrastructure. As per a paper released by Bessemer, the Indian IT sector is projected to reach $400 billion by 2030, with AI playing a key role in this growth.

However, the foundations of the AI boom rest on a narrow and vulnerable layer: the access to computer or hardware resources that make AI models work. For decades, India's tech dominance has come from scale through millions of engineers, global outsourcing contracts and cost efficiency. AI is reshaping that equation.

Ranjit Tinaikar, CEO of Ness Digital Engineering, says, "GenAI is transforming the entire software development industry by significantly increasing productivity and accelerating innovation cycles, ultimately reducing time to market. However, its potential will not be fulfilled if it is viewed as a mere code generation tool, a flawed approach that is common in the world of software development."

The new winners are not service providers but platform builders, like companies that own models, data pipelines and automation systems. With players like Sarvam AI, NxtGen, and BharatGen, India is beginning to build core AI IP, foundation models, agentic platforms and developer tools.

That shift is already visible. AI-native firms such as Graph AI and Leena AI are building software-first businesses with minimal human intervention. Hybrid players like Crescendo and Shopdeck are combining automation with human oversight to increase speed and reduce costs. Infrastructure firms like Scal...
