title: Rajeev Surendran Assary on using artificial intelligence to boost scientific
  and technological discovery
---

His work supports battery innovation, critical materials research and other efforts at Argonne.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and computing are becoming increasingly useful as assistants in the search for the next promising ingredient for advanced batteries, next-generation fuels and more. At the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory, these tools are wielded by materials scientists who have spent decades exploring how different materials play a role in the future of energy.

Rajeev Surendran Assary is one of those scientists. Starting at the lab as a postdoctoral researcher 16 years ago, he is now a chemist and group leader in Argonne's Materials Science division, managing research on understanding and discovering new materials and interfaces that underpin new frontiers in energy conversion, storage and chemical transformation. Here, he talks about his work.

"Conventionally, people discover by trial and error, doing experiments. Our job is to enable that scientific understanding much faster." -- Rajeev Surendran Assary, Argonne chemist

Q: What is the focus of your research at Argonne?

A: My role as a group leader and a scientist is to use reliable predictive modeling at the atomistic scale and state-of-the-art AI approaches to accelerate materials discovery in energy storage and conversion. Conventionally, people discover by trial and error, doing experiments. Our job is to enable that scientific understanding much faster. I think of it like an expert handyman who comes to your house and can do a lot of different types of projects. We are the molecular material handymen of Argonne.

Q: How does your work relate specifically to energy storage and battery research?

A: If you want to build a better battery -- one that stores more energy, stays charged longer or uses a different type of chemistry for supply chain reasons -- then you need to start with the components. You might want to optimize the properties of the electrolyte, which allows t...
