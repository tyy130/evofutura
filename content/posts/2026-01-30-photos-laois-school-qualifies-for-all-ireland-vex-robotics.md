A Laois school has qualified for the All-Ireland VEX robotics final in Cork, after flying through the competition in Mountmellick this week.

Rosenallis NS saw two of their robotics teams qualify for the final, their first time to reach this height in the competition.

This is the school's second time in two weeks to make history, with sixth class student Bobbee Friel representing the school for the first time in the Leinster Schools minor swimming gala.

"This is more great news for our lovely school," principal Rory Walsh told the Leinster Express / Laois Live.

"The kids have put in tremendous work and practice to earn this and we couldn't be prouder of them. They took home another double teamwork award, robot skills award and Excellence award to cap off a great day's work," the principal praised.

The students worked with teacher Aaron Mackessy on their fantastic robots.

"Many thanks to Laois County Council, Seanie Morris, Antoinette Brennan, Dead Hodge, Ray Bell and Kelly Keogh for organising a super day for all the schools who took part today," Mr Walsh said.

"A massive thank you to all the parents who came to support the team and get the teams to and from the event. Roll on Cork at the end of February!" the principal finished.
