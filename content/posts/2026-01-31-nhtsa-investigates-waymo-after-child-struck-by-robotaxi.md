title: NHTSA Investigates Waymo After Child Struck by Robotaxi
---

A federal safety inquiry follows a collision involving a driverless Waymo vehicle near Grant Elementary School

Federal safety regulators are investigating Waymo after one of the company's driverless vehicles struck a child, who sustained minor injuries, near Grant Elementary School in Santa Monica during morning drop-off on Jan. 23. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is now reviewing the incident as scrutiny grows around how autonomous vehicles operate in school-zone conditions.

Waymo said the child walked onto the roadway from behind a tall SUV and moved directly into the vehicle's path.

The company said, "The Waymo driver braked hard, reducing speed from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made."

Waymo also added the simulations of the vehicle suggest an alert human driver would not have avoided a collision in the same scenario.

Waymo called 911 after the child quickly stood up and moved to the sidewalk. Following the call, the vehicle stayed on scene until police cleared it and reported the incident to NHTSA.

NHTSA released details of the investigation on Jan. 29, stating Waymo notified the agency's Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) that one of its autonomous vehicles hit a child near an elementary school.

The incident comes as Waymo faces broader federal scrutiny tied to how its vehicles respond to school-related traffic controls. In October 2025, NHTSA opened a separate preliminary evaluation into Waymo's performance around stopped school buses. And on Jan. 23, the National Transportation Safety Board also opened an investigation into reports of robotaxis illegally passing stopped school buses in multiple states, according to TechCrunch.

Investigators will review how Waymo vehicles operate in and around school zones, particularly during peak pickup and dropoff hours, along with whether they're complying with posted speed limits. As well as examining Waymo's actions after the collision.
