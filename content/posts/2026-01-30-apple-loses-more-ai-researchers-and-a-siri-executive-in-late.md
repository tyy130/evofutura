title: Apple Loses More AI Researchers and a Siri Executive in Latest Departures
---

The company has struggled to keep up with peers in the artificial intelligence race, and a decision to outsource some technology to Alphabet Inc.'s Google has rankled staff, contributing to an exodus of talent from its AI ranks.

In Zirui Wang's case, the researcher is joining Google DeepMind, which is helping Apple build the core AI models that will power new features. That includes the technology underpinning an upgraded version of the Siri voice assistant that's launching this year.

In another previously unreported development, Apple executive Stuart Bowers left for Google DeepMind as well. He was one of the company's most senior executives working on Siri.

Bowers had been a top leader on Apple's failed self-driving car project before becoming one of the managers in charge of turning around the company's voice assistant. He got an expanded role last year working on Siri's ability to figure out how to respond to a user. In that role, he reported to new Siri chief Mike Rockwell.
