title: To Build FSD, Is Elon Musk Being Cortés And Burning His Ships?
---

Is Elon Musk's strategy, betting the future of Tesla on the success of their efforts to make a working self-driving system with a camera-only machine learning car, similar to that of the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, who legend says burned his ships so that his crew could not return home, leaving them no choice but to conquer Mexico?

Tesla's plan has been very different from the strategies of companies like Alphabet/Waymo, GM/Cruise, Amazon/Zoox, Baidu Apollo and others. These teams have taken a make-it-work first approach, using whatever hardware necessary, expecting the cost of the hardware to plummet with time and scale as is generally the case for digital electronics. Tesla chose a low-cost hardware suite (cameras and a custom processor) already present in their cars with the hope that enough software effort, particularly machine learning, would make the system work safely enough with that hardware.

So far, the more popular approach has been a success. Waymo put their first no-driver car on the road in 2017, was running general vehicles empty in 2019 and today is giving about 350,000 autonomous rides per week to paying customers. Baidu is doing about 250,000 rides/week. Cruise was operating but was shut down because of a cover-up around a key safety issue. Tesla, on the other hand, does not have a working system that can drive unsupervised many years after the other companies pulled it off.

This week, however, they claimed they had made it work, and deployed a small number of robotaxis with no supervisor in the car, stating that they will have large fleets deployed soon in many cities. Their demonstrations have included chase cars, and much evidence points to Tesla having built a remote supervision and even remote driving system, which would allow them to do these demos without having a fully unsupervised system working.

Making things work with cheaper hardware is harder, as the results show. It offers some potential to be better at scaling, but mostly...
