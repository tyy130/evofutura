title: How Elon Musk cost Tesla the European market

Musk repeatedly told investors he would put an affordable model on the market to reach more consumers, along with lofty goals of self-driving cars that would pay for themselves. None of these promises have to come to fruition.

In need of a refresh

"His involvement in politics arrived at a very bad moment for the brand because the brand needed and still needs fresh products," said Felipe Munoz, an industry analyst running research firm Car Industry Analysis. "The self-driving features are his next bet."

It's a promise Musk has been making for well over a decade, telling investors in 2015 that fully autonomous vehicles were just three years away. But Tesla's efforts to deliver on that promise are mired with lawsuits, fatalities and regulatory investigations.

Musk dubbed the technology Full Self Driving, while in reality drivers must be prepared to take over at any moment. That marketing has prompted lawsuits in the U.S., Germany and other countries that say Tesla is misleading customers.

That same technology is at the heart of multiple wrongful death lawsuits brought by the families of those killed in accidents that occurred while FSD was engaged.

It is now the subject of an investigation by the U.S. road safety agency, which revealed late last year it had received dozens of reports that the self-driving cars had broken traffic laws, including not stopping for red lights and driving on the wrong side of the road.

The problems aren't stopping Musk from continuing to make bold claims. In an earnings call with investors late Wednesday, the billionaire announced he is stopping production of two models and turning investments toward robotaxis and robots.
