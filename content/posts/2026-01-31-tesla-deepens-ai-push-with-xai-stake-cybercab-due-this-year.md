AUSTIN, Texas: Tesla said it will invest US$2 billion in Chief Executive Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup xAI, underscoring the company's push to reposition itself as an AI and robotics leader as it prepares to begin production of its Cybercab robotaxi later this year.

The announcement supports Musk's long-stated vision of shifting Tesla beyond electric vehicles toward autonomy, robotics, and software, a strategy that underpins much of the company's roughly $1.5 trillion valuation. Tesla also reiterated that production plans for the Cybercab remain on track for this year, a key reassurance for investors after repeated delays to earlier robotaxi targets.

Tesla shares rose about 3.5 percent in after-hours trading, before paring gains to trade up around 1.8 percent after executives outlined sharply higher capital spending plans.

Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said Musk's plans, which include Cybercabs, humanoid robots, Semi trucks, and Roadster sports cars, would push Tesla's capital expenditures above $20 billion this year, more than double the $8.5 billion spent in 2025.

Tesla is "entering a transition phase" in which investors are being asked to underwrite future revenue from self-driving software and robotaxi services before vehicle sales rebound, said Thomas Monteiro, a senior analyst at Investing.com.

"(That) makes rollout metrics, not deliveries, the most important leading indicator from here," Monteiro said.

Musk, who has previously made inaccurate forecasts about robotaxi rollouts, said he expects fully autonomous vehicles to operate across a quarter to half of the United States by the end of this year. He had earlier said robotaxis would reach half the U.S. population by the end of 2025, then narrowed the goal to deploying in eight to 10 major metropolitan areas. Tesla has since missed those targets, launching only a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas.

Tesla's core EV business, still its primary source of revenue, remains unde...
