title: Why driverless cars aren't the upgrade London thinks they are
---

'Autonomous cars are coming to London!' 'UK to be European leader in driverless tech!'

Before you join the jubilant chorus, here are some things to consider.

American city streets, unlike London, are predominantly arranged in grids, with a traffic light or a stop sign at every junction. But even there, armies of hidden humans are needed to monitor the bots driving the cars.

Secondly, safety. We're told autonomous cars have fewer accidents; but that's only true in America, which has way more road deaths per mile driven than Germany, with no speed limit, or Italy, where everyone drives like Nino Farina.

Why? Because American cars are already so heavily 'assisted' that their drivers are half-asleep all the time. Safe driving requires more attention, not less.

Thirdly: you may have picked up during the recent fracas over Greenland that it's not altogether wise to add transport to the long list of vital activities already controlled by US companies.

But there's another aspect nobody talks about: the massive amounts of energy needed by the computers controlling these vehicles - not the onboard computers in all cars, just the ones needed to do the driving.

A recent paper laid it out (bit.ly/49SmlIW): "'It can range from 500 watts for a Tesla to 2.5 kilowatts for an experimental autonomous vehicle equipped with LiDAR and onboard computers... the Waymo Driver self-driving system consumes approximately 1 kW of power, using a mix of LiDAR, cameras, and radar.'

Meanwhile a human driver does the job on 24 watts of completely renewable energy, while listening to Heart FM and planning what to make for supper from three eggs, two potatoes and a week-old head of fennel.

So, every autonomous 'driver' uses 20 to 100 times as much energy as a human. How can this be?

Humans have understanding, evolution and life experience. Bots have data.

Human drivers know what to pay atten...
