The GDC 2026 State of the Game Industry full report is out with "over 2,300" professionals in the industry surveyed, and here's some of the highlights from it. Not ideal for a comparison to last year's survey, as there was a drop from 3,000 people surveyed in 2025 but still an interesting insight into the health of the industry.

Starting with the rough side of things, sadly their data shows 11% of people survey were laid off in the last 24 months, and 17% were laid off in the last 12 months. 41% of those laid off were as a result of their studio being acquired, 63% because the studio closed and 13% due to mergers.

Onto game engines from the survey 42% are using Unreal Engine, 30% on Unity, 19% on some other proprietary / in-house game engine and 5% use Godot.
