title: We rode in dozens of driverless robotaxis in China. Here's what we saw  --  and
  our advice for other curious travelers.

Intrigued by automated driving? Perhaps you've already tried one of the real Waymo or Zoox robotaxis in the United States. (Tesla's "robotaxis" probably don't count yet.)

China is the other real global hotspot for automated driving, with some of its biggest companies eager to expand around the world. Yet many people in the West -- even many experts -- don't really understand what's happening on China's streets. Often, we hear people simply claim that China is either way ahead or way behind.

Together, we have more than three decades of experience working on automated driving in industry and academia. Since meeting at Stanford University, we've collectively spent countless hours riding in Chinese as well as American robotaxis.

We wrote this piece to share our experiences in China and to help you plan -- or even daydream -- your own.

Perhaps you'll marvel as your robotaxi skillfully navigates streets filled not just with cars but with bikes going every which way. Or you might sit sheepishly as it tries to turn itself around in a crowded intersection. You'll see some passersby who are shocked you're in a car without a driver, as well as others who are just annoyed you're in their way.

In other words, you'll encounter everyday people as they -- and you -- try to make sense of the robotaxis coming our way fast.

Here's what we've learned about robotaxis in China on our (driverless) adventures, and here's how you can ride too.

China's three largest robotaxi developers are Baidu Apollo, Pony.ai, and WeRide. Each operates in China and is also pursuing services in other parts of the world, including Europe and the Middle East.

Baidu Apollo is the automated driving unit of Baidu (BIDU on Nasdaq), often compared to Alphabet, which owns both Waymo and Google. You can get the Baidu Apollo Go app by searching for 萝卜快跑 in a Chinese app store. The first part of this name intentionally sounds like "robot," but it actually means "radish."

Pony.AI (PONY on Nasdaq) is a startup ...
