  Intelligence'

As we look back on 2025, AI and open source have fundamentally changed how software is built. Generative AI, automated pipelines, and ubiquitous open source have dramatically increased developer velocity and expanded what teams can deliver -- while shifting risk into the everyday decisions developers make as code is written, generated, and assembled.

Organizations must acknowledge this shift and embrace an AI-powered SDLC, ensuring the right guardrails are embedded directly into the flow of development. Legacy "shift left" approaches haven't kept up. Moving security checks earlier often just moves friction earlier, without integrating security into how developers actually work.

In 2026, progress will depend on embedding security intelligence directly into the developer flow. Model Context Protocols (MCPs) enable this by creating a shared, machine-readable understanding of code, components, policies, and risk across developer tools, agentic AI systems, and security platforms. This allows developers -- and the AI systems supporting them -- to receive guidance at the moment decisions are made, not after the fact.

At Sonatype, we see MCPs as foundational to a true shift-left model: one where developers move faster with confidence, security becomes a natural part of building software, and governance is enforced through intelligence rather than interruption. The challenge ahead isn't choosing between speed and safety. It's making the secure path the easiest one to take.

"As the future of long-standing, government-backed organizations like NIST, CISA, and MITRE grows uncertain, the cybersecurity industry stands at a pivotal moment. The expiration of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act and the potential defunding of the CVE program signal a glaring shift in how the industry coordinates, communicates, and defends against adversaries. At the same time, blurred lines between state and private actors present the opportunity for hackers to target 'offensive' players as...
