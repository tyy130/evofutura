title: Google's Project Genie 3 generates playable game worlds, raising questions
  for future of game development
---

For the last few months, gamers have largely let big dev studios know that AI is non-negotiable in games. From the fears of Larian's ongoing use, ARC Raiders' voice-acting debacle, and even Gen AI art in both Black Ops 6 and Battlefield 6, it is a bit wild. But now, Google has unleashed Project Genie 3 for US AI Pro subscribers.

The tool is your standard prompt model, requiring players to enter a prompt. It will attempt to generate a 3D space to explore based on your queries. The demo on the site shows simple things, like a dog wandering around a front porch. But implementing it in a gaming setting seems to create some super interesting worlds. It's creating video game-like levels with physics, models, graphics and other content.

Project Genie is making games by recognizing triple-A titles

An X account called fofrAI has the subscription, and highlights some prompt optimization for the Project Genie 3. It's able to make mini games out of the prompts for exploring and platforming-style games.

It gets to the point where users can highlight video game assets, and it can learn and train in a contextualized way. One user even posted a video of Zelda's incoming Breath of the Wild-style gameplay.

It's uncanny.

The user did it by getting Grok to make a Zelda image, for some reason. Throw that image into Project Genie, and off it went, making a level based on that image. The level features Zelda-like gliding mechanics, and its art style too.

There's also some other gaming mechanics involved with the likes of GTA-style worlds, where players travel around the map in helicopters. Other game examples were from Dark Souls, with a similar UI, respawn when you fall off mechanics, and more.

I reckon you could probably prompt Anthem-style gameplay if you wanted to, especially with Anthem being dead at the moment for that thrill visual flying style.

What does it mean for gaming?

As it stands, it can only really generate for up to a minute of exploration before it starts stugg...
