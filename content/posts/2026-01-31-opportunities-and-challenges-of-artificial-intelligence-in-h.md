As 'omics data proliferate (Supplementary Table 1), their integration is delivering system-level insights to identify candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets. AI/ML is essential to manage these complex datasets, although high heterogeneity, dimensionality, and processing variability challenge reproducibility and clinical translation.

As the volume of multimodal data expands, so does the potential for identifying novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools. Large-scale data commons (e.g., UK Biobank, NHANES) and focused liver-specific initiatives (e.g., SteatoSITE) support both conventional hypothesis-driven and data-driven, hypothesis-free analyses to uncover patterns beyond conventional clinical paradigms.

Current diagnostic pipelines combine patient history with isolated serological, radiological, and histological assessments. Applied to non-invasive tests (NITs), AI/ML approaches could uncover more subtle, multimodal signatures preceding symptoms, enabling earlier diagnosis, scalable screening, and more informed clinical decision-making. A comprehensive overview of diagnostic applications of AI in hepatology is provided in Supplementary Table 2.

AI/ML is being widely applied to radiological assessments of liver health. For example, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pipelines applied to CT images accurately segmented whole livers and detected malignancies, offering a potential tool for rapid triage. Similar approaches on ultrasounds and MRIs delivered accurate fibrosis staging. Assigning histological features of disease activity, such as steatosis grading from CT images or predicting hepatocyte ballooning scores from ultrasounds, has also been possible. Other CNN-based models have characterised features such as vasculature, ascites, and body fat.

Histology remains the gold standard for some disease assessment. Multiple AI/ML computational histopathology pipelines were developed to provide reproducible, granular, and interpretable feature quantifi...
