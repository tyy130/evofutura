By early 2023, he had founded his own artificial intelligence and machine learning company in China and was serving as its chief executive officer.

In investor presentations, Ding claimed he could build an AI supercomputer by copying and modifying Google's technology. The jury found that the stolen trade secrets related to hardware and software that allow Google's data centers to train and operate large AI models.
