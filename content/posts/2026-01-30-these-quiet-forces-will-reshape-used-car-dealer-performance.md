Behind rising online activity and changing demand patterns lies a behavioural shift that's forcing dealerships to rethink strategy, digital execution, and the role of artificial intelligence.

In 2026, the South African automotive industry won't be reshaped by sudden disruption, but by steady and measurable behavioural change.
