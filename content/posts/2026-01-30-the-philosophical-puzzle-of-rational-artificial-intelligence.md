To what extent can an artificial system be rational?

A new MIT course, 6.S044/24.S00 (AI and Rationality), doesn't seek to answer this question. Instead, it challenges students to explore this and other philosophical problems through the lens of AI research. For the next generation of scholars, concepts of rationality and agency could prove integral in AI decision-making, especially when influenced by how humans understand their own cognitive limits and their constrained, subjective views of what is or isn't rational.

This inquiry is rooted in a deep relationship between computer science and philosophy, which have long collaborated in formalizing what it is to form rational beliefs, learn from experience, and make rational decisions in pursuit of one's goals.

"You'd imagine computer science and philosophy are pretty far apart, but they've always intersected. The technical parts of philosophy really overlap with AI, especially early AI," says course instructor Leslie Kaelbling, the Panasonic Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at MIT, calling to mind Alan Turing, who was both a computer scientist and a philosopher. Kaelbling herself holds an undergraduate degree in philosophy from Stanford University, noting that computer science wasn't available as a major at the time.

Brian Hedden, a professor in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, holding an MIT Schwarzman College of Computing shared position with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), who teaches the class with Kaelbling, notes that the two disciplines are more aligned than people might imagine, adding that the "differences are in emphasis and perspective."
