  IAIRO

New Delhi [India], January 30: A decisive shift in India's artificial intelligence journey is in the making with the formal launch of Indian AI Research Organisation (IAIRO), a pioneering institution and a national beacon dedicated to foundational and applied AI research aligned with India's core challenges and priorities. Aimed at catalysing the shift - from strategy formulation to sovereignty and streamlined execution from prototypes and IP to global products - the launch of IAIRO comes at a pivotal moment backed by a position paper titled 'Sovereign AI for India's Strategic Autonomy' by Dr Amit Sheth, the Founding Director of IAIRO.

Unlike consumer-oriented large language models (LLMs) that are 'monolithic and generalistic', IAIRO will focus on next generation of AI models, that are custom (domain specific), compact (small), neurosymbolic (utilizing not just data but knowledge and human expertise), within a composite framework (involving hybrid agents). This will make them much more cost effective to train and deploy. Such models are expected to be at the core of global products supporting high value, mission critical enterprise applications as well.

IAIRO is firmly committed to establishing, for AI, the same concentrated national capability that ISRO achieved for the space sector. The organisation's unique ecosystem will nurture talent, develop sovereign intellectual property, bring on board entrepreneurs in residence and startups, with cl...
