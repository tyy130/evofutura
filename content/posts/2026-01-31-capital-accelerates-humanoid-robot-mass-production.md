title: Capital accelerates humanoid robot mass production
---

The Beijing Innovation Center of Humanoid Robotics on Thursday launched a pilot manufacturing and validation platform for humanoid robots, the first of its kind in the capital, transforming the industry from small-batch prototyping to large scale production.

According to the center, the platform is equipped with 500 sets of production and testing equipment and has an annual pilot production capacity of up to 5,000 embodied humanoid robots. It offers one-stop services including prototyping, performance and process validation, process optimization, module and whole-robot assembly, and testing and verification.

The launch comes as the global humanoid robotic industry moves beyond research and development toward application scenarios and commercial trials, with the transition from innovation to industrialization remaining a major challenge, as the sector lacks professional, standardized, and efficient pilot manufacturing infrastructure.

"Across the industry, the main bottlenecks lie in pilot manufacturing readiness, standardized production and testing, and the lack of data continuity from development to scale-up," said Liu Yizhang, head of the pilot platform.

He said research institutes and startups typically rely on small, self-developed trial lines that are costly and inefficient. Gaps in standardization make it difficult to ensure consistent quality and reliability, while incomplete end-to-end testing system can leave risks unaddressed before products reach real-world applications.

At the same time, limited data accumulation across the product life cycle weakens the feedback loop needed for large-scale production, he added.

These concerns are echoed at the policy level, where authorities have pointed to a broader shortage of pilot manufacturing and validation capacity across emerging and future industries.

In November 2025, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology identified humanoid robots as a representative area that demands faster construction o...
