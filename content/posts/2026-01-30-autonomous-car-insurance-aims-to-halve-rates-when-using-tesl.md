The company claims that using this insurance can cut costs in half.

Although earlier generations thought we'd have flying cars by now, what's becoming the new goal is self-driving cars. With both autonomous driving and AI on the rise, we should have suspected it'd only be a matter of time before the two combined in the insurance landscape.

That's where Lemonade, an AI-driven digital insurance company, is aiming to make a mark. The company has introduced a new car insurance concept that is designed for semi-autonomous cars.

This idea is rolling out as a collaboration with Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system, also known as FSD. The company claims it could cut insurance rates by 50%.

Many automakers are working on developing self-driving cars. None are there yet. Names like FSD can make the systems sound more capable than they are, which worries safety advocates.

Automakers use a five-level system to track their efforts. Most today have a Level 2 system, like Tesla's FSD. It can steer, accelerate, and brake a car if a driver is paying constant attention to correct its mistakes.

Several automakers say they have Level 3 systems in the works, which will let drivers safely look away from the road if they're ready to take over when prompted. So far, only Mercedes sells one of these, and only in Nevada and parts of California.

This comes at a time when electric vehicles are much pricier to insure, so it might be seen as a relief to some. However, it's equally important to keep in mind other costs behind this self-driving insurance. That being, the data you're giving over when you commit.

Your driving data will be fed into Lemonade's "usage-based risk prediction models" to allow for research into "uniquely distinguishing between autonomous and human driving." Lemonade claims that, with access to Tesla vehicle data previously deemed unavailable, this research will enable safer driving over time in thes...
