title: 'Israel''s infrastructure paradox: Innovation without environmental foundations
  - opinion'
---

Gaps in Israel's grid capacity, public transport systems, waste treatment facilities, and regulatory frameworks mean that many innovations to improve the environment cannot be deployed at a meaningful scale.

At the heart of Israel's environmental challenges lies a paradox. It is a highly developed country, globally recognized for technological excellence and innovation, with ambitions to lead in advanced computing, artificial intelligence, data centers, clean energy, and climate technologies.

At the same time, it suffers from deep and persistent gaps in basic environmental infrastructure: waste management, public transportation, wastewater treatment, electricity grids, and the protection of open spaces. These two realities are unfolding simultaneously - and increasingly, they collide.

Regional hub

Israel's technological prowess is undeniable. The country is positioning itself as a hub for data centers that support high-performance computing and AI, serving domestic, regional, and European markets.

This ambition carries major implications for energy demand. Electricity demand in Israel has increased at an annual average of 2.3% in recent years, with current projections indicating an acceleration to an average annual growth rate of 3.5% through 2050 - an extraordinary rate for a small, dense country.

The challenge is not only producing more electricity. It is about system reliability, flexibility, and resilience. Data centers require uninterrupted, high-quality power.

At the same time, Israel is undergoing parallel transitions: rapid growth in electric vehicles, electrification of industry, and expanding desalination to cope with climate-driven water stress - all of which are energy-intensive. These pressures are unfolding in a country with one of the highest population growth rates in the developed world.

What makes this picture especially striking is that Israel has world-leading climate and clean-technology companies addressing many of these challenges. Isr...
