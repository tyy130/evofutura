KITE programme to familiarise students with new exam patterns to begin on Sunday with focus on ICT and robotics

KITE Victers is set to launch 'Munnorukkam' (exam readiness), a specialised series designed to familiarise students with the new examination pattern that has been implemented from this academic year in the wake of the curriculum revision in the State.

The broadcast will begin on Sunday (February 1, 2026), with initial focus on students appearing for the SSLC (Class X) examinations.

This year's SSLC ICT practical examination includes robotics, making Kerala the first State in the country to integrate robotics into school-level practical exams.

Sessions for Class X

In light of the ICT practical exams starting on February 2, the inaugural 'Munnorukkam' session on February 1 will be dedicated to ICT and robotics.

Following this, classes for Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Hindi, English, Social Science, Malayalam, and other languages will be telecast from February 2 to February 10.

The sessions will be aired daily at 5.30 p.m., with re-telecasts scheduled for 8 a.m. and 2 p.m. the following day.

Other classes

Following the Class X segments, specialised sessions analysing the annual exam question patterns for other classes will begin on February 11.

The next phase of the SSLC programme will be launched following the model examinations, K. Anvar Sadath, CEO of KITE, said in a statement.

'Munnorukkam' will be available live on the KITE Victers web portal (www.victers.kite.kerala.gov.in) and the KITE Victers mobile app.

The classes will be available for viewing later on the official Victers YouTube channel (youtube.com/itsvicters).

As KITE Victers is part of the Prasar Bharati network, viewers need to contact their cable/DTH operators if the channel is not available in their current packages.
