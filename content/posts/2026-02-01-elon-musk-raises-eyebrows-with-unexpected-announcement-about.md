Why is this important?

The emergence of self-driving EVs was undoubtedly a milestone for tech enthusiasts and forward-thinking dreamers, but autonomous EVs hold significance for everyday consumers as well. They could revolutionize transportation, making it cleaner, safer, and more affordable.

According to its safety data, Waymo's self-driving EVs have led to 90% less crashes with serious injury or worse compared to an average human driver.

However, in 2025, Tesla struggled to inspire confidence as sales lagged. Of course, Musk's foray into politics diminished the brand's reputation in the eyes of many. A series of high-profile robotaxi crashes has also ra...
