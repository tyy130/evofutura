The amazing effects are being used as entertainment icons, "presenters" in media advertisements, political witnesses, and as everyday companions for grieving families.

It has just been published in the journal New Media & Society under the title "Artificially alive: An exploration of AI resurrections and spectral labor modes in a postmortal society."

The researchers analyze more than 50 real-world cases from the US, Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia where AI technologies are used to recreate deceased people's voices, faces, and personalities. The study offers one of the most comprehensive looks yet at this unsettling frontier and raises urgent questions about consent, exploitation, and power in a world where the dead can be digitally revived.
