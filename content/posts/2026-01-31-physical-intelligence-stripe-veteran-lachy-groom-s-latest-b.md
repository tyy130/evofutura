title: Physical Intelligence, Stripe veteran Lachy Groom's latest bet, is building

From the street, the only indication I've found Physical Intelligence's headquarters in San Francisco is a pi symbol that's a slightly different color than the rest of the door. When I walk in, I'm immediately confronted with activity. There's no reception desk, no gleaming logo in fluorescent lights.

Inside, the space is a giant concrete box made slightly less austere by a haphazard sprawl of long blonde-wood tables. Some are clearly meant for lunch, dotted with Girl Scout cookie boxes, jars of Vegemite (someone here is Australian), and small wire baskets stuffed with one too many condiments. The rest of the tables tell a different story entirely. Many more of them are laden with monitors, spare robotics parts, tangles of black wire, and fully assembled robotic arms in various states of attempting to master the mundane.

During my visit, one arm is folding a pair of black pants, or trying to. It's not going well. Another is attempting to turn a shirt inside out with the kind of determination that suggests it will eventually succeed, just not today. A third - this one seems to have found its calling - is quickly peeling a zucchini, after which it is supposed to deposit the shavings into a separate container. The shavings are going well, at least.

"Think of it like ChatGPT, but for robots," Sergey Levine tells me, gesturing toward the motorized ballet unfolding across the room. Levine, an associate professor at UC Berkeley and one of Physical Intelligence's cofounders, has the amiable, bespectacled demeanor of someone who has spent considerable time explaining complex concepts to people who don't immediately grasp them.

What I'm watching, he explains, is the testing phase of a continuous loop: data gets collected on robot stations here and at other locations -- warehouses, homes, wherever the team can set up shop -- and that data trains general-purpose robotic foundation models. When researchers train a new model, it comes back to stations like these for evaluatio...
