Last month, RTÉ's This Week reported that 500 instances of cheating using AI was detected by higher-level institutions last year.

However, many of the largest universities in the country including UCD, UCC, UL, Maynooth and Trinity said that they do not distinguish between cheating using AI and other forms of plagiarism.

This means the number of students using AI to cheat is likely significantly higher.

With a follow up request, some of the universities have said that they are changing their oversight of academic cheating.

University College Cork said that from this academic year, beginning last September, an academic misconduct register will be in place which will provide university-wide oversight.

Although the university did not have total figures, there were 46 academic misconduct cases notified to the Student Records and Examinations Office. Of these, 22 arose from unauthorised uses of generative AI.

In a statement UCC said: "We now collect comprehensive data on all forms of academic misconduct defined within the Policy, including the unethical use of generative artificial intelligence.

"This enables the University to better identify trends, manage cases consistently, and respond proactively to emerging challenges within the sector such as AI-related misconduct."

University of Limerick introduced a new academic policy this year which specifically includes generative AI but does not hold centralised records for the year 2024/2025.

Thirty people were sanctioned for academic misconduct at the university level, but this does not include those that were detected and handled at department-level.

Trinity College Dublin does not specifically count uses of AI in their records of academic misconduct and does not yet have data on the number of instances of academic misconduct that took place last year.

However, the university ...
