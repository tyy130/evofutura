title: I replaced Microsoft Paint with a powerful open-source alternative
---

Nick Lewis is an editor at How-To Geek. He has been using computers for 20 years --- tinkering with everything from the UI to the Windows registry to device firmware. Before How-To Geek, he used Python and C++ as a freelance programmer. In college, Nick made extensive use of Fortran while pursuing a physics degree.

Nick's love of tinkering with computers extends beyond work. He has been running video game servers from home for more than 10 years using Windows, Ubuntu, or Raspberry Pi OS. He also uses Proxmox to self-host a variety of services, including a Jellyfin Media Server, an Airsonic music server, a handful of game servers, NextCloud, and two Windows virtual machines.

He enjoys DIY projects, especially if they involve technology. He regularly repairs and repurposes old computers and hardware for whatever new project is at hand. He has designed crossovers for homemade speakers all the way from the basic design to the PCB.

Nick enjoys the outdoors. When he isn't working on a computer or DIY project, he is most likely to be found camping, backpacking, or canoeing.

It isn't the type of program to get huge, sweeping updates after each version of Windows. After all, it is designed to be simple and reliable above all else.

There are two major exceptions in recent versions of Windows: Paint 3D and Paint with Copilot.

Paint 3D was the version of Paint introduced with the Windows 10 Creators update, failed to gain any traction with users, and was event...
