The risk artificial intelligence poses to students outweighs its benefits, concludes a Brookings Institution report released earlier this month.

Yet the reality is that 85% of teachers and 86% of students across the country used AI at some level during the 2024-25 school year, according to a study by the Center for Democracy and Technology. And 69% of high school students said they use AI tools regularly to find information, and 54% use them to answer questions, according to College Board surveys.

Advocates of AI highlight its potential to personalize education and boost productivity, while skeptics are concerned that students may become overly reliant on the technology.

"The risks are undermining young people's ability to think independently, take feedback, relate to each other, and have a trusting [teacher-student] relationship," said Rebecca Winthrop, a director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution and a lead researcher on the group's report about AI.

In a conversation with Education Week, Winthrop discussed the report's findings and the best ways to utilize benefits while minimizing risks when using AI in schools.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What are the benefits of using AI for student learning?

What we found was that there are real benefits of generative AI for students learning when the power of AI is held back, used very narrowly, integrated with vetted content and good pedagogy.

So things like interactive textbooks or worksheets where kids are reading a paragraph over and over, don't understand it, and are able to say [to AI]: "I don't understand this, explain this to me in a different way." That really helps kids learning.

It can be incredibly helpful for neurodivergent kids. One of the most striking examples is kids with aphasia who have communication problems. All of a sudden, they are able to create a synthetic copy of their voice and communicate in the classroom.

What risks does AI pose...
