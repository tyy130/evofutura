Computer scientist and cognitive psychologist Professor Geoffrey Hinton, 78, won the Nobel Prize in 2024 after popularising the algorithm enabling machines to learn.

Speaking as Amazon announced it was cutting 16,000 corporate workers' jobs - coinciding with a push to invest heavily in AI - he says things are happening so fast it's very hard to see into the future.

He says: "AI already has subjective experiences and I think it's fairly clear that if we weren't talking to philosophers, we'd agree that AI was aware.

"There's a lovely conversation where an AI says to the people testing it, 'now, let's be honest with each other, are you actually testing me?' And the people, the scientists describing that then in the paper say 'the AI was aware that it was being tested.' That's what normal people would call consciousness."

Speaking on LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr - who told listeners that more than a quarter of all workers in Britain fear they're going to lose their jobs in the next five years because of AI - Professor Hinton says manual workers will be at an advantage, as AI gains intellectual ground on human beings.

He says: "We're starting to see jobs in many professions like lawyers being taken over by AI and, in future, we'll see many more. AI is lagging in terms of physical dexterity. Replacing intellectual jobs is going to happen before they replace jobs that require physical dexterity. So I've sometimes said being a plumber will last longer than being a lawyer. We should be worrying about that and trying to do things to protect ourselves against it, but nobody really knows what's going to happen."

Prof. Hinton - now a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto in Canada, focusing on AI safety - resigned from Google in 2023, so he could speak freely about the risks and dangers of A...
