title: The US is headed for mass unemployment, and no one is prepared

According to a provocative new opinion piece published by The Hill, the rapid integration of advanced artificial intelligence into the workforce has moved Universal Basic Income (UBI) from a fringe economic theory to an "inevitable necessity" for preserving American capitalism.

The article, titled "AI Displacement and UBI," warns that the current wave of "agentic AI" is no longer just automating repetitive tasks but is now actively displacing high-skill knowledge workers at a rate that traditional safety nets cannot absorb, creating a crisis that requires an immediate, radical restructuring of the social contract.

The piece argues that the "Great Reskilling" narrative promoted by tech giants is largely a myth. Unlike previous industrial revolutions where workers moved from farms to factories, or factories to desks, the current AI revolution is erasing the "desk" itself.

The author cites recent labor data suggesting that up to 30% of administrative, legal, and financial analysis roles could be rendered obsolete by 2027.

With no clear "next sector" emerging to absorb this displaced white-collar workforce, the article posits that decoupling income from traditional labor is the only way to prevent a catastrophic collapse in consumer demand.

To fund this proposed UBI, the article outlines a potential "Compute Tax" or "National Data Dividend." Instead of taxing human labor -- which is shrinking -- the government would levy a tax on the massive server farms and data processing centers owned by the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies.

The logic is that since these models are trained on the collective data of the public internet, the public is entitled to a dividend from the immense wealth they generate.

The piece concludes by urging lawmakers to pass the bipartisan "AI Workforce Stabilization Act," arguing that without a guaranteed floor of income, the economic efficiency gained by AI will be rendered useless by a populace that can no longer afford to buy the products...
