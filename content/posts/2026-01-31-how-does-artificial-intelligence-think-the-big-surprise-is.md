title: How does artificial intelligence think? The big surprise is that it 'intuits'
---

Artificial intelligence was born in the 1950s when a group of pioneers wondered if they could make their computers "think." After 70 years, something tremendous has happened: neural networks are solving cognitive tasks. For 300,000 years, these tasks were the exclusive domain of living beings. Not anymore. It's not controversial: it's a fact. And it has happened suddenly. Machine learning with neural networks has solved problems that eluded machines for decades:

AI researcher François Chollet sums it up this way: "In the last decade, deep learning has achieved nothing less than a technological revolution." Each of these achievements would have been a remarkable breakthrough on its own. Solving them all with a single technique is like discovering a master key that unlocks every door at once.

Why now? Three pieces converged: algorithms, computing power, and massive amounts of data. We can even put faces to them, because behind each element is a person who took a gamble. Academic Geoffrey Hinton kept working on neural networks long after his colleagues had abandoned them. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, kept improving parallel‑processing chips far beyond what video games -- the core of his business -- actually needed. And researcher Fei‑Fei Li risked her career to build ImageNet, an image collection that seemed absurdly large at the time.

But these three pieces aligned. In 2012, two of Hinton's students, Ilya Sutskever and Alex Krizhevsky, combined them to achieve spectacular success: they built AlexNet, a neural network capable of "seeing" -- recognizing images -- far better than anything that had come before.

The rumor spread quickly through the laboratories: this worked. Hinton's team had found a formula: networks, data, and computing in gigantic quantities.

The impact of this transformation will be profound. As Ethan Mollick, one of the most astute observers of our time, has said, even if AI development were to stop tomorrow, "we would still have a decade of chang...
