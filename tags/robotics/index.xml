Read it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every tech company right now is being judged on the delicate dance between industry transformation and business preservation. This week we got a better read on how CEOs are weighing risk against long-term ambition. Take Microsoft. For the first time ever, it posted a $50 billion quarter in cloud revenue, up $10 billion from a decade ago. But that growth wasnâ€™t good enough for Wall Street, and yesterdayâ€™s stock drop wiped out $357 billion in value, its steepest fall since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>MITO AI: $4.5 Million Pre-Seed Funding Closed For Collaborative AI Video Creation Platform</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-mito-ai-4-5-million-pre-seed-funding-closed-for-collaborat/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:27:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-mito-ai-4-5-million-pre-seed-funding-closed-for-collaborat/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;MITO AI, a Madrid- and San Francisco-based startup building a collaborative platform for AI-native video creation, has raised a $4.5 million pre-seed round led by Paul Murphy at Lightspeed Venture Partners. The company said the financing included participation from Kibo, Kfund, Sequoia, and A16Z scouts, LifeX, and angel investors, including unicorn founders and executives with ties to USV, Roblox, and GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company positions MITO as an AI orchestration layer for video production, combining foundational video, image, and audio models with professional editing tools within a browser-based, infinite-canvas environment. MITO said the product is designed for filmmakers, designers, and creative teams, with real-time collaboration features that enable multiple stakeholders to work together simultaneously in a &amp;ldquo;multiplayer&amp;rdquo; environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Apple AI Pin Explained: Is This Screenless Wearable Worth Wearing Every Day?</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-apple-ai-pin-explained-is-this-screenless-wearable-worth-we/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:26:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-apple-ai-pin-explained-is-this-screenless-wearable-worth-we/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Apple AI Pin is shaping up to be Apple&amp;rsquo;s boldest rethink of personal computing since the Apple Watch. Instead of another screen, it leans into voice, vision, and context, clipping discreetly to clothing for hands-free interaction. Designed as an iPhone companion rather than a replacement, the Apple AI Pin raises a practical question: does removing the screen make everyday tasks easier, or just more awkward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early details point to a wearable that listens, sees, and responds instantly without pulling a phone from your pocket. Apple AI aims to make interactions feel ambient rather than deliberate. Whether that shift improves daily life depends less on novelty and more on how naturally it fits into real routines.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI-Powered, People-Driven, Cox Automotive Showcases Industry-Leading Capabilities and an Unmatched Breadth of Technology at NADA 2026</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-ai-powered-people-driven-cox-automotive-showcases-industry/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:03:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-ai-powered-people-driven-cox-automotive-showcases-industry/</guid><description>&lt;ul&gt;

From the fears of Larian&amp;rsquo;s ongoing use, ARC Raiders&amp;rsquo; voice-acting debacle, and even Gen AI art in both Black Ops 6 and Battlefield 6, it is a bit wild. But now, Google has unleashed Project Genie 3 for US AI Pro subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool is your standard prompt model, requiring players to enter a prompt. It will attempt to generate a 3D space to explore based on your queries. The demo on the site shows simple things, like a dog wandering around a front porch. But implementing it in a gaming setting seems to create some super interesting worlds.

On the other hand, the U.S. market is facing uncertainty, particularly due to a decline in inbound tourism in 2025, which has caused some concern for future performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Are Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) Impacting the Sector?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant shifts identified in the report is the growth of Online Travel Agencies (OTAs), which now account for 37% of all bookings for tours and activities, up from 33% in 2024. This surge reflects the ongoing importance of OTAs in the digital age and their growing dominance in the travel experiences market.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rajeev Surendran Assary on using artificial intelligence to boost scientific and technological discovery</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-rajeev-surendran-assary-on-using-artificial-intelligence-to/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 19:55:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-rajeev-surendran-assary-on-using-artificial-intelligence-to/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;His work supports battery innovation, critical materials research and other efforts at Argonne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump Administration&amp;rsquo;s AI Action Plan addresses the role of AI in this global game and creates a necessary framework for the U.S. to establish and protect its advantage. I believe it provides a solid foundation of policy, security, and incentives, but its ultimate success is incumbent on the level of engagement from the private sector and the underlying talent infrastructure required to bring vision to reality.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>MARKETING NEWS The age of the dupe: why counterfeits are reshaping brand value</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-marketing-news-the-age-of-the-dupe-why-counterfeits-are-res/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 19:24:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-marketing-news-the-age-of-the-dupe-why-counterfeits-are-res/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Piracy, clone, dupe&amp;hellip; Counterfeiting has evolved and is no longer a clandestine act or reserved for the black market&lt;/p&gt;

In 2026, so-called &amp;ldquo;dupes&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; products that imitate the aesthetics or functionality of premium brands &amp;ndash; have become normalized as part of aspirational and cultural consumption, especially among Generation Z.

&lt;p&gt;On January 29, 2026, Apple announced the acquisition of Israeli artificial intelligence startup Q.ai for an estimated $1.5-2 billion, making it the company&amp;rsquo;s largest acquisition since Beats in 2014. The announcement arrived just days after Apple reported its latest quarterly earnings, a set of numbers that once again reinforced an uncomfortable truth for the rest of the technology industry: Apple&amp;rsquo;s margins remain structurally resilient, its product economics unusually stable, and its long-term roadmap largely insulated from the turbulence affecting peers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Self-driving cars, drones hijacked by custom road signs</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-self-driving-cars-drones-hijacked-by-custom-road-signs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 14:30:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-self-driving-cars-drones-hijacked-by-custom-road-signs/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Indirect prompt injection occurs when a bot takes input data and interprets it as a command.

&lt;p&gt;In a new class of attack on AI systems, troublemakers can carry out these environmental indirect prompt injection attacks to hijack decision-making processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>To Build FSD, Is Elon Musk Being Cortés And Burning His Ships?</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-to-build-fsd-is-elon-musk-being-cortes-and-burning-his-ship/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:43:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-to-build-fsd-is-elon-musk-being-cortes-and-burning-his-ship/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Is Elon Musk&amp;rsquo;s strategy, betting the future of Tesla on the success of their efforts to make a working self-driving system with a camera-only machine learning car, similar to that of the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, who legend says burned his ships so that his crew could not return home, leaving them no choice but to conquer Mexico?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla&amp;rsquo;s plan has been very different from the strategies of companies like Alphabet/Waymo, GM/Cruise, Amazon/Zoox, Baidu Apollo and others. These teams have taken a make-it-work first approach, using whatever hardware necessary, expecting the cost of the hardware to plummet with time and scale as is generally the case for digital electronics. Tesla chose a low-cost hardware suite (cameras and a custom processor) already present in their cars with the hope that enough software effort, particularly machine learning, would make the system work safely enough with that hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Systematic Review of Machine Learning Techniques for Predicting Compressive and Flexural Strength of Mortars - Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-a-systematic-review-of-machine-learning-techniques-for-predi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:06:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-a-systematic-review-of-machine-learning-techniques-for-predi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Considering these aspects, a detailed discussion of ML models and their hyperparameter configurations is presented in the following section for the most frequently employed algorithms identified in the reviewed studies &amp;ndash; namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Gradient/Extreme Gradient Boosting (GB/XGBoost).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present section provides a comprehensive discussion of the most frequently used models for predicting mortar mechanical properties, as summarized in Table 2. This selection reflects the most widely applied and validated machine learning algorithms in the literature for predicting mortar performance. While deep learning (DL) approaches have shown great potential in civil and materials engineering, particularly for image-based tasks like microstructural analysis or crack detection, their methodology differs significantly from conventional ML techniques. DL models, such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks, are designed for high-dimensional, unstructured data, relying on automatic feature extraction rather than predefined input variables. This review focuses on conventional ML methods, which are more applicable to mortar research and allow for easier comparison of performance across studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Deep QP Safety Filter: Model-free Learning for Reachability-based Safety Filter</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-deep-qp-safety-filter-model-free-learning-for-reachability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-deep-qp-safety-filter-model-free-learning-for-reachability/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21297v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: We introduce Deep QP Safety Filter, a fully data-driven safety layer for black-box dynamical systems. Our method learns a Quadratic-Program (QP) safety filter without model knowledge by combining Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability with model-free learning. We construct contraction-based losses for both the safety value and its derivatives, and train two neural networks accordingly. In the exact setting, the learned critic converges to the viscosity solution (and its derivative), even for non-smooth values. Across diverse dynamical systems &amp;ndash; even including a hybrid system &amp;ndash; and multiple RL tasks, Deep QP Safety Filter substantially reduces pre-convergence failures while accelerating learning toward higher returns than strong baselines, offering a principled and practical route to safe, model-free control.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Disturbance-Aware Flight Control of Robotic Gliding Blimp via Moving Mass Actuation</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-disturbance-aware-flight-control-of-robotic-gliding-blimp-vi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-disturbance-aware-flight-control-of-robotic-gliding-blimp-vi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21188v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: Robotic blimps, as lighter-than-air (LTA) aerial systems, offer long endurance and inherently safe operation but remain highly susceptible to wind disturbances. Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments. Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show that the integrated MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control, demonstrating its effectiveness for disturbance-aware LTA flight.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>InspecSafe-V1: A Multimodal Benchmark for Safety Assessment in Industrial Inspection Scenarios</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-inspecsafe-v1-a-multimodal-benchmark-for-safety-assessment/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-inspecsafe-v1-a-multimodal-benchmark-for-safety-assessment/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21173v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: With the rapid development of industrial intelligence and unmanned inspection, reliable perception and safety assessment for AI systems in complex and dynamic industrial sites has become a key bottleneck for deploying predictive maintenance and autonomous inspection. Most public datasets remain limited by simulated data sources, single-modality sensing, or the absence of fine-grained object-level annotations, which prevents robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning for industrial foundation models. To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles. The dataset is constructed from 41 wheeled and rail-mounted inspection robots operating at 2,239 valid inspection sites, yielding 5,013 inspection instances. For each instance, pixel-level segmentation annotations are provided for key objects in visible-spectrum images. In addition, a semantic scene description and a corresponding safety level label are provided according to practical inspection tasks. Seven synchronized sensing modalities are further included, including infrared video, audio, depth point clouds, radar point clouds, gas measurements, temperature, and humidity, to support multimodal anomaly recognition, cross-modal fusion, and comprehensive safety assessment in industrial environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WheelArm-Sim: A Manipulation and Navigation Combined Multimodal Synthetic Data Generation Simulator for Unified Control in Assistive Robotics</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-wheelarm-sim-a-manipulation-and-navigation-combined-multimo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-wheelarm-sim-a-manipulation-and-navigation-combined-multimo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21129v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: Wheelchairs and robotic arms enhance independent living by assisting individuals with upper-body and mobility limitations in their activities of daily living (ADLs). Although recent advancements in assistive robotics have focused on Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arms (WMRAs) and wheelchairs separately, integrated and unified control of the combination using machine learning models remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of WheelArm, an integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) that combines wheelchair and robotic arm controls. Data collection is the first step toward developing WheelArm models. In this paper, we present WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection. We evaluate its capability by collecting a manipulation and navigation combined multimodal dataset, comprising 13 tasks, 232 trajectories, and 67,783 samples. To demonstrate the potential of the WheelArm dataset, we implement a baseline model for action prediction in the mustard-picking task. The results illustrate that data collected from WheelArm-Sim is feasible for a data-driven machine learning model for integrated control.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Project Genie: Experimenting with infinite, interactive worlds</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-29-project-genie-experimenting-with-infinite-interactive-worl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:01:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-29-project-genie-experimenting-with-infinite-interactive-worl/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. can try out Project Genie, an experimental research prototype that lets you create and explore worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
