From the fears of Larian&amp;rsquo;s ongoing use, ARC Raiders&amp;rsquo; voice-acting debacle, and even Gen AI art in both Black Ops 6 and Battlefield 6, it is a bit wild. But now, Google has unleashed Project Genie 3 for US AI Pro subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool is your standard prompt model, requiring players to enter a prompt. It will attempt to generate a 3D space to explore based on your queries. The demo on the site shows simple things, like a dog wandering around a front porch. But implementing it in a gaming setting seems to create some super interesting worlds. It&amp;rsquo;s creating video game-like levels with physics, models, graphics and other content.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Boosting your brain with a chip carries a price</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-boosting-your-brain-with-a-chip-carries-a-price/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:00:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-boosting-your-brain-with-a-chip-carries-a-price/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This column reflects the personal views of the author and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Use AI to automate analysis, improve productivity and enhance data quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern architecture brings together structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. There are two prevailing strategies to do so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strategy is complementary. Each repository addresses different analytical uses at different points in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data lakes lie at the front end of the pipelines and store raw data. They&amp;rsquo;re optimized for getting data into the analytics platform. Teams use landing zones and independent data sandboxes for ingestion and discovery. These native format data stores are open to private consumers for selective use. Analytics are generally limited to time-sensitive insights and exploratory inquiry by consumers who can work with data that is not yet standardized.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Google's Project Genie Is Not for You</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-google-s-project-genie-is-not-for-you/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 19:58:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-google-s-project-genie-is-not-for-you/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Google has a whole new world for people to play inâ€&amp;ldquo;but only for a minute.

Abstract: Parameter tuning is a powerful approach to enhance adaptability in model predictive control (MPC) motion planners. However, existing methods typically operate in a myopic fashion that only evaluates executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to the sparsity of failure events (e.g., obstacle nearness or collision). To cope with this issue, we propose to extend evaluation from executed to non-executed actions, yielding a hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) framework that combines both a fast-level tuning and a slow-level tuning. The fast one adopts risk indicators of predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and the slow one leverages an extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Additionally, we integrate HPTune with the Doppler LiDAR that provides obstacle velocities apart from position-only measurements for enhanced motion predictions, thus facilitating the implementation of HPTune. Extensive experiments on high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning and outperforms various baseline schemes in complex environments. It is found that HPTune enables situation-tailored motion planning by formulating a safe, agile collision avoidance strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Quick Heuristic Validation of Edges in Dynamic Roadmap Graphs</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-quick-heuristic-validation-of-edges-in-dynamic-roadmap-graph/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-quick-heuristic-validation-of-edges-in-dynamic-roadmap-graph/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.20968v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of adjusting roadmap graphs for robot motion planning to non-static environments. We introduce the &amp;ldquo;Red-Green-Gray&amp;rdquo; paradigm, a modification of the SPITE method, capable of classifying the validity status of nodes and edges using cheap heuristic checks, allowing fast semi-lazy roadmap updates. Given a roadmap, we use simple computational geometry methods to approximate the swept volumes of robots and perform lazy collision checks, and label a subset of the edges as invalid (red), valid (green), or unknown (gray). We present preliminary experimental results comparing our method to the well-established technique of Leven and Hutchinson, and showing increased accuracy as well as the ability to correctly label edges as invalid while maintaining comparable update runtimes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>D4RT: Teaching AI to see the world in four dimensions</title><link>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-16-d4rt-teaching-ai-to-see-the-world-in-four-dimensions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-16-d4rt-teaching-ai-to-see-the-world-in-four-dimensions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;D4RT: Unified, efficient 4D reconstruction and tracking up to 300x faster than prior methods.&lt;/p&gt;
