I haven&rsquo;t seen a lot of that.</p><p>[ Westwood Robotics ]</p><p>Last year, Helix showed that a single neural network could control a humanoid&rsquo;s upper body from pixels. Today, Helix 02 extends that control to the entire robot &ndash; walking, manipulating, and balancing as one continuous system.</p><p>Why yes, I am a normal human and this is very similar to the default state of my kitchen.</p><p>[ Figure ]</p><p>Harry Goldstein, our Editor in Chief, went to meet Sprout from Fauna Robotics. He was skeptical at first, but Sprout won him over with its robotic charm.</p><p>Kimberly Elenberg is showing how the data collected by robotic responders can save lives in mass casualty events.</p><p>The educational robotics market is tough, but you&rsquo;ve got to hand it to Sphero &ndash; going strong since 2011, which is pretty incredible.</p><p>How do you remotely control robots that change shape? We introduce a method for user-guided control of modular robots using reconfigurable joint-space joysticks (JoJo) and real-time optimization. We demonstrate this system on two different robots, Mori3 and Roombots. The video shows examples of these robots performing object manipulation, locomotion, human-assistance, and reconfiguration, controlled by our system.</p><p><a href=https://spectrum.ieee.org/multitasking-robot>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://spectrum.ieee.org/multitasking-robot target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
