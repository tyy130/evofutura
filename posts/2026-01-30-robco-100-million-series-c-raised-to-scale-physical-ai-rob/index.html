The company, founded in 2020, builds AI-enabled robotic systems designed to operate inside real production environments, targeting industrial use cases where autonomy and adaptability are increasingly critical.</p><p>The round was co-led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Lingotto Innovation, an investment management company owned by Exor. Additional investors participating include Sequoia Capital, Greenfield Partners, Kindred Capital, Leitmotif, and The Friedkin Group. RobCo positioned the syndicate as a mix of venture investors with experience scaling software-led technology companies and industrial backers with long-term relationships and sector connectivity.</p><p>RobCo&rsquo;s platform combines perception, motion planning, and self-learning methods intended to reduce the gap between existing factory processes and end-to-end automation. The company emphasized its vertically integrated approach, developing hardware and software together as a full-stack system, and described its robots as capable of learning task-specific skills through demonstration and self-learning rather than manual programming. RobCo also framed its product as a &ldquo;single pane of glass&rdquo; for customers managing deployments.</p><p>The company&rsquo;s expansion strategy is increasingly U.S.-focused. RobCo entered the U.S. in 2025 and now operates in San Francisco and Austin, describing the country as both a strategic priority and a major growth market as manufacturers pursue automation amid labor constraints, reshoring initiatives, and rising operational complexity. RobCo said its robots are deployed across multiple industrial environments, naming BMW and additional customers including DynaEnergetics, Fabricated Extrusion Company, T-Systems, and Rosenberger.</p><p>RobCo said it delivers its Autonomous Manufacturing &mldr;</p><p><a href=https://pulse2.com/robco-100-million-series-c-raised-to-scale-physical-ai-robotics-in-u-s-and-europe/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://pulse2.com/robco-100-million-series-c-raised-to-scale-physical-ai-robotics-in-u-s-and-europe/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the original article →</a></aside><section class=related-articles><h2>More Articles</h2><div class=related-grid><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-in-the-ai-age-aeur-slow-and-steadyaeurtm-doesnaeurtmt-really-win/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805108/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/in-the-ai-age-aeur-slow-and-steadyaeurtm-doesnaeurtmt-rea.jpg alt="RobCo: $100 Million Series C Raised To Scale Physical AI Robotics In U.S. And Europe" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>In the AI age, â€~slow and steadyâ€™ doesnâ€™t really win</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-mito-ai-4-5-million-pre-seed-funding-closed-for-collaborat/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805110/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/mito-ai-4-5-million-pre-seed-funding-closed-for.jpg alt="RobCo: $100 Million Series C Raised To Scale Physical AI Robotics In U.S. And Europe" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>MITO AI: $4.5 Million Pre-Seed Funding Closed For …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-why-ai-doesn-t-think-like-humans-how-its-unique-strength/><div class=related-card-content><h3>Why AI Doesn't Think Like Humans -- How Its Unique Strength …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a></div></section></article><script>(function(){const e=document.getElementById("reading-progress");if(!e)return;function t(){const n=window.scrollY,t=document.documentElement.scrollHeight-window.innerHeight,s=t>0?n/t*100:0;e.style.width=Math.min(100,s)+"%"}window.addEventListener("scroll",t,{passive:!0}),t()})()</script></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
