The discussion explored how robotics and AI technologies are moving beyond software applications into physical-world implementations across multiple sectors.</p><p>Rafael Silva, research analyst at VettaFi, highlighted healthcare robotics as one area experiencing rapid growth. Medical robot installations increased 91% in 2024, delivering better patient outcomes through implementations such as more precise surgical capabilities.</p><p>The ongoing synergies between AI and robotic applications allow for enhanced imaging and more controlled movements than traditional surgical approaches, Silva noted. The technology spans from surgical robots to rehabilitation devices that assist patients in recovery.</p><p>The robotics ecosystem extends beyond end-use applications to include component manufacturers and materials suppliers, according to Silva. Companies producing robotic hands, battery technologies, and raw materials play essential roles in enabling robotics deployment across industries.</p><p>The panel discussed how investors can gain exposure to these opportunities through ETFs focused on the robotics and AI space. The ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index ETF (ROBO), the ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF (THNQ), and the ROBO Global Healthcare Technology & Innovation ETF (HTEC) all provide access to companies throughout the value chain.</p><p>These funds allow investors to own the entire AI disruption story rather than attempting to select individual winners, according to panelists.
