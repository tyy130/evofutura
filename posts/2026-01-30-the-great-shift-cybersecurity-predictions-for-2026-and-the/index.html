Generative AI, automated pipelines, and ubiquitous open source have dramatically increased developer velocity and expanded what teams can deliver &ndash; while shifting risk into the everyday decisions developers make as code is written, generated, and assembled.</p><p>Organizations must acknowledge this shift and embrace an AI-powered SDLC, ensuring the right guardrails are embedded directly into the flow of development. Legacy &ldquo;shift left&rdquo; approaches haven&rsquo;t kept up. Moving security checks earlier often just moves friction earlier, without integrating security into how developers actually work.</p><p>In 2026, progress will depend on embedding security intelligence directly into the developer flow. Model Context Protocols (MCPs) enable this by creating a shared, machine-readable understanding of code, components, policies, and risk across developer tools, agentic AI systems, and security platforms. This allows developers &ndash; and the AI systems supporting them &ndash; to receive guidance at the moment decisions are made, not after the fact.</p><p>At Sonatype, we see MCPs as foundational to a true shift-left model: one where developers move faster with confidence, security becomes a natural part of building software, and governance is enforced through intelligence rather than interruption. The challenge ahead isn&rsquo;t choosing between speed and safety. It&rsquo;s making the secure path the easiest one to take.</p><p>&ldquo;As the future of long-standing, government-backed organizations like NIST, CISA, and MITRE grows uncertain, the cybersecurity industry stands at a pivotal moment. The expiration of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act and the potential defunding of the CVE program signal a glaring shift in how the industry coordinates, communicates, and defends against adversaries. At the same time, blurred lines between state and private actors present the opportunity for hackers to target &lsquo;offensive&rsquo; players as&mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.sonatype.com/blog/the-great-shift-cybersecurity-predictions-for-2026-and-the-new-era-of-threat-intelligence>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.sonatype.com/blog/the-great-shift-cybersecurity-predictions-for-2026-and-the-new-era-of-threat-intelligence target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
