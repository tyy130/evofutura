<span class=source>via Investing.com UK</span></div></header><div class=article-body><p>Investing.com &ndash; Apple Inc. has lost at least four more artificial intelligence researchers in recent weeks, Bloomberg reported Friday.</p><p>The departing researchers include Yinfei Yang, who left to start a new company, while Haoxuan You and Bailin Wang joined Meta, the report said. You moved to Meta&rsquo;s Superintelligence research division, and Bailin Wang is now working on Meta&rsquo;s recommendations systems.</p><p>Access breaking news faster with institutional-grade feeds, immediate stock impact metrics, and analyst response tracking &ndash; get 55% off InvestingPro.</p><p>Meanwhile, researcher Zirui Wang has joined Google DeepMind, the same company that is helping Apple build core AI models for new features, including technology for an upgraded version of Siri launching this year.</p><p>In another development, Stuart Bowers, a senior executive working on Siri, has also left for Google DeepMind. Bowers had previously been a top leader on Apple&rsquo;s self-driving car project before becoming one of the managers tasked with improving the company&rsquo;s voice assistant. Last year, he received an expanded role focused on Siri&rsquo;s response capabilities, reporting to new Siri chief Mike Rockwell.</p><p>These exits highlight ongoing challenges within Apple&rsquo;s AI division as the company struggles to keep pace with competitors in the artificial intelligence field. The decision to outsource some technology to Alphabet Inc.&rsquo;s Google has reportedly caused discontent among staff, contributing to what has become an exodus of talent, particularly from Apple&rsquo;s AI teams.</p><p><a href=https://uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-loses-more-ai-researchers-to-meta-and-google-deepmind-4480888>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://uk.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/apple-loses-more-ai-researchers-to-meta-and-google-deepmind-4480888 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the original article →</a></aside><section class=related-articles><h2>More Articles</h2><div class=related-grid><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-in-the-ai-age-aeur-slow-and-steadyaeurtm-doesnaeurtmt-really-win/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805108/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/in-the-ai-age-aeur-slow-and-steadyaeurtm-doesnaeurtmt-rea.jpg alt="Apple loses more AI researchers to Meta and Google DeepMind By Investing.com" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>In the AI age, â€~slow and steadyâ€™ doesnâ€™t really win</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-mito-ai-4-5-million-pre-seed-funding-closed-for-collaborat/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805110/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/mito-ai-4-5-million-pre-seed-funding-closed-for.jpg alt="Apple loses more AI researchers to Meta and Google DeepMind By Investing.com" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>MITO AI: $4.5 Million Pre-Seed Funding Closed For …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-why-ai-doesn-t-think-like-humans-how-its-unique-strength/><div class=related-card-content><h3>Why AI Doesn't Think Like Humans -- How Its Unique Strength …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a></div></section></article><script>(function(){const e=document.getElementById("reading-progress");if(!e)return;function t(){const n=window.scrollY,t=document.documentElement.scrollHeight-window.innerHeight,s=t>0?n/t*100:0;e.style.width=Math.min(100,s)+"%"}window.addEventListener("scroll",t,{passive:!0}),t()})()</script></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
