The company said the financing included participation from Kibo, Kfund, Sequoia, and A16Z scouts, LifeX, and angel investors, including unicorn founders and executives with ties to USV, Roblox, and GitHub.</p><p>The company positions MITO as an AI orchestration layer for video production, combining foundational video, image, and audio models with professional editing tools within a browser-based, infinite-canvas environment. MITO said the product is designed for filmmakers, designers, and creative teams, with real-time collaboration features that enable multiple stakeholders to work together simultaneously in a &ldquo;multiplayer&rdquo; environment.</p><p>MITO said its platform supports workflows that span early ideation through final delivery, including moodboarding, storyboarding, scripting, camera angles, visual effects, and multi-format outputs. The company also described an AI copilot that users can direct to execute specific actions, designed to accelerate production while preserving creative control, consistency, and quality.</p><p>Beyond the software platform, MITO said it is building a broader creative ecosystem that includes an AI-powered audiovisual studio already working with TV and film production companies, along with a curated marketplace of generative creators. With the new capital, the company said it plans to accelerate its effort to make professional storytelling tools more accessible to creators and creative teams.</p><p>KEY QUOTES</p><p><a href=https://pulse2.com/mito-ai-4-5-million-pre-seed-funding-closed-for-collaborative-ai-video-creation-platform/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://pulse2.com/mito-ai-4-5-million-pre-seed-funding-closed-for-collaborative-ai-video-creation-platform/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the original article →</a></aside><section class=related-articles><h2>More Articles</h2><div class=related-grid><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-in-the-ai-age-aeur-slow-and-steadyaeurtm-doesnaeurtmt-really-win/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805108/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/in-the-ai-age-aeur-slow-and-steadyaeurtm-doesnaeurtmt-rea.jpg alt="MITO AI: $4.5 Million Pre-Seed Funding Closed For Collaborative AI Video Creation Platform" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>In the AI age, â€~slow and steadyâ€™ doesnâ€™t really win</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-why-ai-doesn-t-think-like-humans-how-its-unique-strength/><div class=related-card-content><h3>Why AI Doesn't Think Like Humans -- How Its Unique Strength …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-apple-ai-pin-explained-is-this-screenless-wearable-worth-we/><div class=related-card-content><h3>Apple AI Pin Explained: Is This Screenless Wearable Worth …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a></div></section></article><script>(function(){const e=document.getElementById("reading-progress");if(!e)return;function t(){const n=window.scrollY,t=document.documentElement.scrollHeight-window.innerHeight,s=t>0?n/t*100:0;e.style.width=Math.min(100,s)+"%"}window.addEventListener("scroll",t,{passive:!0}),t()})()</script></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
