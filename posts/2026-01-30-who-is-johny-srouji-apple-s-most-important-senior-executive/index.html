It hinges on silicon. At the centre of that transformation is Johny Srouji, the executive who reshaped Apple&rsquo;s economics, margins, and competitive moat at the nanometre scale.</p><p>On January 29, 2026, Apple announced the acquisition of Israeli artificial intelligence startup Q.ai for an estimated $1.5-2 billion, making it the company&rsquo;s largest acquisition since Beats in 2014.
