For the 2026 State of the Game Industry Report, 2,300 were surveyed for the latest one and were asked about a variety of topics, including generative AI.</p><p>Overall, 36% of the game developers surveyed used generative AI (828 people), with &ldquo;business professionals&rdquo; and &ldquo;upper management&rdquo; using it more than your rank-and-file game developers. ChatGPT was the most commonly used external AI tool, and the technology was mostly used for &ldquo;research and brainstorming.&rdquo;</p><p>While generative AI is clearly being used by some developers, the sentiment around the use of technology is more negative than ever before. To be more specific, 52% of game developers surveyed (1,196 people) said that generative AI is having a negative impact on the game industry. Last year, only 30% of developers responded that way. Only 7% said it had a positive impact, while the rest were mixed on its use.</p><p>One anonymous game design supervisor went as farm as to tell the surveyors &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather quit the industry than use generative AI.&rdquo; Ultimately, the reality is that the technology is being used, but disdain for its use, especially for content players actually see, is growing. Many players also don&rsquo;t like the use of generative AI, as games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and Divinity have faced backlash over their use of it.</p><p><a href=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-developers-than-ever-believe-generative-ai-is-hurting-the-game-industry/1100-6537793/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-developers-than-ever-believe-generative-ai-is-hurting-the-game-industry/1100-6537793/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the original article →</a></aside><section class=related-articles><h2>More Articles</h2><div class=related-grid><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-federal-cio-outlines-one-government-blueprint-for-overhaul/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805679/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/federal-cio-outlines-one-government-blueprint-fo.jpg alt="More Developers Than Ever Believe Generative AI Is Hurting The Game Industry" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>Federal CIO outlines 'one government' blueprint for …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-the-best-ai-stock-that-nobody-s-talking-about-for-2026/><div class=related-card-content><h3>The Best AI Stock That Nobody's Talking About for 2026</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-buzz-about-broadcom-s-custom-chips-is-testing-but-not-break/><div class=related-card-content><h3>Buzz about Broadcom's custom chips is testing, but not …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a></div></section></article><script>(function(){const e=document.getElementById("reading-progress");if(!e)return;function t(){const n=window.scrollY,t=document.documentElement.scrollHeight-window.innerHeight,s=t>0?n/t*100:0;e.style.width=Math.min(100,s)+"%"}window.addEventListener("scroll",t,{passive:!0}),t()})()</script></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
