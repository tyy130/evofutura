Executed on Dec. 8 and 10, and led by the agency&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, the demonstration used generative AI to create waypoints for Perseverance, a complex decision-making task typically performed manually by the mission&rsquo;s human rover planners.</p><p>&ldquo;This demonstration shows how far our capabilities have advanced and broadens how we will explore other worlds,&rdquo; said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman. &ldquo;Autonomous technologies like this can help missions to operate more efficiently, respond to challenging terrain, and increase science return as distance from Earth grows. It&rsquo;s a strong example of teams applying new technology carefully and responsibly in real operations.&rdquo;</p><p>During the demonstration, the team leveraged a type of generative AI called vision-language models to analyze existing data from JPL&rsquo;s surface mission dataset. The AI used the same imagery and data that human planners rely on to generate waypoints - fixed locations where the rover takes up a new set of instructions - so that Perseverance could safely navigate the challenging Martian terrain.</p><p>The initiative was led out of JPL&rsquo;s Rover Operations Center (ROC) in collaboration with Anthropic, using the company&rsquo;s Claude AI models.</p><p>Progress for Mars, beyond</p><p>Mars is on average about 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) away from Earth. This vast distance creates a significant communication lag, making real-time remote operation - or &ldquo;joy-sticking&rdquo; - of a rover impossible. Instead, for the past 28 years, over several missions, rover routes have been planned and executed by human &ldquo;drivers,&rdquo; who analyze the terrain and status data to sketch a route using waypoints, which are usually spaced no mor&mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.miragenews.com/perseverance-rovers-first-ai-driven-mars-trek-1611417/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.miragenews.com/perseverance-rovers-first-ai-driven-mars-trek-1611417/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
