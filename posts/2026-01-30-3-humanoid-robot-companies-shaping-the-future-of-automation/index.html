But suddenly, humanoid robots are showing up in warehouses, factories, and investor pitch decks with real urgency.</p><p>Thanks to rapid advances in AI, better hardware, and a flood of funding, a small group of companies is racing to build the first truly useful general-purpose robot worker. Dozens of startups are chasing the humanoid dream, but three names stand out as the ones most likely to define what comes next.</p><p>Here are the three humanoid robot companies to watch closely as robots begin stepping off the stage and into the workforce.</p><ol><li>Figure AI - The startup moving fastest toward real-world deployment</li></ol><p>If there&rsquo;s one humanoid robotics company that feels like it&rsquo;s in a hurry, it&rsquo;s Figure AI.</p><p>Figure has quickly become one of the most talked-about startups in the space, thanks to major funding, bold goals, and a clear focus on getting robots into commercial environments sooner rather than later.</p><p>Their flagship machine, Figure 01, is designed to handle general-purpose tasks like moving objects, assisting with repetitive labor, and operating in environments built for humans.</p><p>What makes Figure especially interesting is that it isn&rsquo;t positioning humanoids as futuristic household helpers. Instead, the company is aiming at the most obvious first market: industrial work. Factories and warehouses are structured, predictable environments where humanoid robots can actually provide value today.</p><p>Figure has also attracted attention through early partnerships and pilot programs, including work connected to major manufacturers.</p><p>Why to watch: Figure is acting less like a research lab and more like a company trying to ship &mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.eweek.com/news/3-humanoid-robot-companies-automation/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.eweek.com/news/3-humanoid-robot-companies-automation/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the original article →</a></aside><section class=related-articles><h2>More Articles</h2><div class=related-grid><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-in-the-ai-age-aeur-slow-and-steadyaeurtm-doesnaeurtmt-really-win/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805108/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/in-the-ai-age-aeur-slow-and-steadyaeurtm-doesnaeurtmt-rea.jpg alt="3 Humanoid Robot Companies Shaping the Future of Automation" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>In the AI age, â€~slow and steadyâ€™ doesnâ€™t really win</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-mito-ai-4-5-million-pre-seed-funding-closed-for-collaborat/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805110/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/mito-ai-4-5-million-pre-seed-funding-closed-for.jpg alt="3 Humanoid Robot Companies Shaping the Future of Automation" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>MITO AI: $4.5 Million Pre-Seed Funding Closed For …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-why-ai-doesn-t-think-like-humans-how-its-unique-strength/><div class=related-card-content><h3>Why AI Doesn't Think Like Humans -- How Its Unique Strength …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a></div></section></article><script>(function(){const e=document.getElementById("reading-progress");if(!e)return;function t(){const n=window.scrollY,t=document.documentElement.scrollHeight-window.innerHeight,s=t>0?n/t*100:0;e.style.width=Math.min(100,s)+"%"}window.addEventListener("scroll",t,{passive:!0}),t()})()</script></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
