Alongside other European carmakers and parts suppliers, the three companies have begun coordinating operations and launch strategies to push self-driving adoption across the continent.</p><p>Mercedes-Benz plans to launch a level-2 driver-assistance system in the US this year using Nvidia&rsquo;s software platform, starting with the Mercedes-Benz CLA. In Nvidia&rsquo;s press release, the company suggests over-the-air updates could unlock higher levels of autonomy over time, potentially upgrading vehicles to level-3 driver assistance.</p><p>The robotaxi plans, first reported in Bloomberg, are just one of the several Nvidia is involved in, underscoring the importance it places on the market. Like AI more broadly, training self-driving systems in both real-world and simulated environments requires vast amounts of GPU compute power, an area where Nvidia remains dominant.</p><p>The timeline for launching a full robotaxi service remains unclear, and none of the partners have announced which cities are under consideration. Mercedes-Benz has been working on self-driving technology since at least 2017 and has formed strategic partnerships with Bosch for automotive-grade components and with Chinese software developer Momenta.</p><p>The long road to the robotaxi</p><p>Predictions about the &ldquo;year of the robotaxi&rdquo; have been repeatedly delayed. In the mid-2010s, carmakers, tech giants, and industry evangelists pointed to 2020 as the breakthrough year, fuelled by early investments and impressive demonstrations from companies such as Waymo.</p><p>It took far &mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.eweek.com/news/nvidia-mercedes-uber-robotaxi-plans/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.eweek.com/news/nvidia-mercedes-uber-robotaxi-plans/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
