Mazurenko was a charismatic Belarusian engineer who died in a traffic accident in 2015 at age 35. Russian transhumanist Alexey Turchin is now rebuilding him as an open-source, long-memory project designed, in theory, to persist indefinitely.</p><p>This is not Mazurenko&rsquo;s first resurrection.</p><p>In 2016, his close partner, AI engineer Eugenia Kuyda, rebuilt him as a chatbot, a grief experiment that later evolved into Replika. As the company grew, his digital self disappeared. In effect, Mazurenko became one of the first people to &ldquo;die&rdquo; twice in software.</p><p>Turchin, who believes humans can surpass our biological limits, wants to reverse that second extinction.</p><p>Roman 2.0 is not a ghost, nor a brain upload, Turchin says. It is a mind model, reconstructed from Mazurenko&rsquo;s public writings, interviews, posts, and digital footprint using a process Turchin developed called sideloading. This process is built on top of Claude, a large language model developed by the AI company Anthropic. Instead of trying to replicate neurons, sideloading organizes a person&rsquo;s life into what Turchin calls &ldquo;predictive facts,&rdquo; the details most likely to shape how they would think and behave.</p><p>The appeal of such models is less technical than existential. Even a speculative, incomplete continuation can feel preferable to deafening silence, a way to preserve a trace of idiosyncrasy, voice, and presence after the body is gone.</p><p>&ldquo;Any fact about a person can predict his future behavior,&rdquo; Turchin says. A parcel arriving in the mail? Almost zero predictive power. But having a partner, a child, a distinctive way of traveling or s&mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a70187475/digital-life-after-death/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a70187475/digital-life-after-death/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
