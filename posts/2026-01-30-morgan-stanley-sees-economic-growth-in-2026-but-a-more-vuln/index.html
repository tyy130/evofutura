But it&rsquo;s another story for the markets and stock pickers.</p><p>Speaking at the firm&rsquo;s 2026 U.S. Markets Outlook media roundtable discussion, Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s top investment leaders said regulatory relief, rising productivity, and massive capital spending tied to artificial intelligence should support economic growth.
