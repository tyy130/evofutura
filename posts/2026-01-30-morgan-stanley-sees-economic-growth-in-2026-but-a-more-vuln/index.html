But it&rsquo;s another story for the markets and stock pickers.</p><p>Speaking at the firm&rsquo;s 2026 U.S. Markets Outlook media roundtable discussion, Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s top investment leaders said regulatory relief, rising productivity, and massive capital spending tied to artificial intelligence should support economic growth. But they warned that elevated equity valuations could make the reward for risk less attractive.</p><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help but feel constructive about the trajectory of economic growth ahead of us,&rdquo; said Vishy Tirupattur, Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s chief fixed-income strategist, pointing to what he described as a rare alignment of policy support, productivity gains, and capital investment.</p><p>Morgan Stanley now expects U.S. GDP to grow 2.6% in 2026.</p><p>A central pillar of that outlook is capital spending.
