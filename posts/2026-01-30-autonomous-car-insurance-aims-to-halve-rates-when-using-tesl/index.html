With both autonomous driving and AI on the rise, we should have suspected it&rsquo;d only be a matter of time before the two combined in the insurance landscape.</p><p>That&rsquo;s where Lemonade, an AI-driven digital insurance company, is aiming to make a mark. The company has introduced a new car insurance concept that is designed for semi-autonomous cars.</p><p>This idea is rolling out as a collaboration with Tesla&rsquo;s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system, also known as FSD. The company claims it could cut insurance rates by 50%.</p><p>Many automakers are working on developing self-driving cars. None are there yet. Names like FSD can make the systems sound more capable than they are, which worries safety advocates.</p><p>Related: Self-Driving Cars - Everything You Need to Know</p><p>Automakers use a five-level system to track their efforts. Most today have a Level 2 system, like Tesla&rsquo;s FSD. It can steer, accelerate, and brake a car if a driver is paying constant attention to correct its mistakes.</p><p>Several automakers say they have Level 3 systems in the works, which will let drivers safely look away from the road if they&rsquo;re ready to take over when prompted. So far, only Mercedes sells one of these, and only in Nevada and parts of California.</p><p>This comes at a time when electric vehicles are much pricier to insure, so it might be seen as a relief to some. However, it&rsquo;s equally important to keep in mind other costs behind this self-driving insurance. That being, the data you&rsquo;re giving over when you commit.</p><p>Your driving data will be fed into Lemonade&rsquo;s &ldquo;usage-based risk prediction models&rdquo; to allow for research into &ldquo;uniquely distinguishing between autonomous and human driving.&rdquo; Lemonade claims that, with access to Tesla vehicle data previously deemed unavailable, this research will enable safer driving over time in thes&mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.kbb.com/car-news/autonomous-car-insurance-aims-to-halve-rates-when-using-teslas-fsd/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.kbb.com/car-news/autonomous-car-insurance-aims-to-halve-rates-when-using-teslas-fsd/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
