According to Bloomberg&rsquo;s Mark Gurman, Apple has been running substantial portions of its AI operations on Anthropic&rsquo;s Claude models rather than relying exclusively on its own proprietary systems, a revelation that underscores the complex realities facing even the world&rsquo;s most valuable technology company as it navigates the generative AI revolution.</p><p>The disclosure, first reported by 9to5Mac, represents a notable departure from Apple&rsquo;s historically insular approach to core technologies. For decades, the company has prided itself on vertical integration &ndash; designing its own silicon, operating systems, and increasingly, the software intelligence that powers user experiences. Yet the demands of large language models and generative AI appear to have prompted a more pragmatic approach, one that acknowledges the technical and resource advantages held by AI-focused companies like Anthropic.</p><p>This partnership arrangement differs fundamentally from Apple&rsquo;s public-facing AI strategy. While the company announced Apple Intelligence as a signature feature of iOS 18, powered primarily by its own models with optional ChatGPT integration for users, the backend infrastructure supporting Apple&rsquo;s internal operations and development workflows apparently relies heavily on Anthropic&rsquo;s technology. The distinction matters because it reveals where Apple believes it can compete directly with AI specialists and where it sees value in leveraging external expertise.</p><p>The Economics of AI Model Development</p><p>Building competitive large language models requires extraordinary capital investment, specialized talent, and computational resources that challenge even companies with Apple&rsquo;s financial reserves. Training runs for frontier AI models can cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, requiring thousands of specialized GPUs running for&mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.webpronews.com/inside-apples-quiet-shift-how-anthropics-claude-powers-cupertinos-ai-infrastructure/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.webpronews.com/inside-apples-quiet-shift-how-anthropics-claude-powers-cupertinos-ai-infrastructure/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
