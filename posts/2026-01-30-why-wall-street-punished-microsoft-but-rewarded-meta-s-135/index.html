Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported earnings that beat expectations, yet lost nearly 10% of its value (a staggering $357 billion evaporation). On the same day, Meta (NASDAQ:META) announced it would nearly double its already-massive AI spending to as much as $135 billion in 2026, and the stock surged 10%, adding hundreds of billions in market cap.</p><p>Both companies are pouring record amounts into artificial intelligence. Both are spending tens of billions per quarter on infrastructure. So why did Wall Street punish one and reward the other?</p><p>The answer isn&rsquo;t in the earnings reports. It&rsquo;s in the power grids, data center timelines, and physical infrastructure constraints that most investors don&rsquo;t see. This reveals a shift in how the market evaluates AI investments: the era of paying for promises is over. The era of demanding proof of delivery has begun.</p><p>The Infrastructure Reality Nobody Wants to Discuss</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t advertise in its earnings presentations: the company has advanced AI chips sitting in warehouses because it doesn&rsquo;t have the electrical power to install them.</p><p>&ldquo;The biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it&rsquo;s power,&rdquo; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella admitted in November 2025. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can&rsquo;t plug in. In fact, that is my problem today.&rdquo;</p><p>Microsoft spent $37.5 billion on capital expenditures in Q2 of fiscal 2026 alone (much of it on cutting-edge GPUs from Nvidia), and those chips are literally collecting dust because the company can&rsquo;t find enough electricity to run them. CFO Amy Hood confirmed on the earnings call that Azure capacity constraints will last &ldquo;at least&rdquo; through the end of Microsoft&rsquo;s fiscal year in June 2026, and possibly longer.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t a software problem.
