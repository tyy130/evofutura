On Thursday, a federal jury found 38-year-old Linwei Ding, also known as Leon Ding, guilty on fourteen total counts &ndash; seven for economic espionage and seven for the theft of trade secrets.</p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t just a simple case of a disgruntled employee taking files on his way out the door; it was a systematic, year-long effort to siphon the &ldquo;brains&rdquo; of Google&rsquo;s supercomputing power for the benefit of the Chinese government.</p><p>During the eleven-day trial, prosecutors painted a picture of a man living a double life. While Ding was officially drawing a paycheck from Google, he was secretly building a parallel career in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China.</p><p>READ: Google Tip Leads FBI To Oklahoma Man For Vowing To Kill &lsquo;As Many&rsquo; Federal Agents &lsquo;As Possible&rsquo;</p><p>Evidence showed that between 2022 and 2023, Ding funneled over two thousand pages of highly sensitive data from Google&rsquo;s internal network into his personal cloud account. He didn&rsquo;t just stop at data theft; he was reportedly shopping himself around to Chinese tech firms, even positioning himself as a prospective Chief Technology Officer and launching his own AI startup while still employed in California.</p><p>The stolen information wasn&rsquo;t just random code. It focused on the very foundation of modern AI: the hardware and software that allow massive data centers to train large-scale language models.</p><p>This included blueprints for Google&rsquo;s custom Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) chips and specialized networking hardware known as SmartNICs. In pitches to overseas investors, Ding was bold, essentially promising that he could replicate Google&rsquo;s massive supercomputing infrastructure by modifying the tech he had taken. He even applied for a state-sponsored &ldquo;talent plan&rdquo; in Shanghai, explicitly stating his goal was to help China&rsquo;s computing power reach international standards.</p><p>U.S. officials didn&rsquo;t mince words after the verd&mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.tampafp.com/silicon-valley-double-agent-jury-convicts-ex-google-engineer-in-landmark-ai-espionage-case/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.tampafp.com/silicon-valley-double-agent-jury-convicts-ex-google-engineer-in-landmark-ai-espionage-case/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the original article →</a></aside><section class=related-articles><h2>More Articles</h2><div class=related-grid><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-federal-cio-outlines-one-government-blueprint-for-overhaul/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805679/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/federal-cio-outlines-one-government-blueprint-fo.jpg alt="Silicon Valley Double Agent: Jury Convicts Ex-Google Engineer In Landmark AI Espionage Case" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>Federal CIO outlines 'one government' blueprint for …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-the-best-ai-stock-that-nobody-s-talking-about-for-2026/><div class=related-card-content><h3>The Best AI Stock That Nobody's Talking About for 2026</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-buzz-about-broadcom-s-custom-chips-is-testing-but-not-break/><div class=related-card-content><h3>Buzz about Broadcom's custom chips is testing, but not …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a></div></section></article><script>(function(){const e=document.getElementById("reading-progress");if(!e)return;function t(){const n=window.scrollY,t=document.documentElement.scrollHeight-window.innerHeight,s=t>0?n/t*100:0;e.style.width=Math.min(100,s)+"%"}window.addEventListener("scroll",t,{passive:!0}),t()})()</script></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
