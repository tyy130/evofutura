This study explores the use of machine learning (ML) models to predict post-treatment outcomes in patients with CLBP undergoing LET and how these predictions can support clinical decision-making. We utilized a retrospective database of 431 consecutive patients with uncomplicated CLBP. Post-treatment variables predicted included LL, NRS pain score, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Input model variables included pre-treatment LL, sacral base angle (SBA), ratio of LL/SBA fit type, NRS, ODI, frequency, duration, LET compliance, and demographic variables of age and BMI. Initial variables were analyzed to predict post-treatment outcomes. Three ML models &ndash; Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) &ndash; were employed to handle both continuous and categorical variables, and performance was evaluated for predictive accuracy. Factors affecting outcomes were identified using Shapley Additive Explanations. Treatment was a multimodal spine rehabilitation program featuring LET applied 3-6 times per week, varied between 4 and 10 weeks, and follow-up was performed at the end of care. Improvements in LL, NRS, and ODI were - 11.5° to - 23.6°, 7.3/10 to 3.3/10, and 33.2% to 10.4%, respectively. Among the ML models, XGBoost demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy for lumbar lordotic angle (R = 0.728) and pain score (R = 0.648), while Random Forest slightly outperformed XGBoost for ODI (0.631 vs. 0.616). MLP performed poorly for ODI predictions (R = 0.201), indicating difficulty in capturing functional disability patterns.
