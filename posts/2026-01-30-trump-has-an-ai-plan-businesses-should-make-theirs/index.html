Businesses Should Make Theirs."><figcaption>Source: RealClearPolicy</figcaption></figure><div class=article-body><p>For much of history, nations that possessed a technological advantage were often more successful economically and geopolitically. Looking forward, it appears that the development and deployment of artificial intelligence, or AI, will determine where those advantages manifest in the 21st century.</p><p>The Trump Administration&rsquo;s AI Action Plan addresses the role of AI in this global game and creates a necessary framework for the U.S. to establish and protect its advantage. I believe it provides a solid foundation of policy, security, and incentives, but its ultimate success is incumbent on the level of engagement from the private sector and the underlying talent infrastructure required to bring vision to reality.</p><p>As major beneficiaries of improvements in technology and productivity, companies have a responsibility to their employees and the wider economy to act as strong private partners to this plan and related efforts across both the public and private sectors. I believe businesses of all sizes can make a meaningful difference by ensuring that their workforces are primed to capitalize on this revolution in economic productivity.</p><p>Many companies are deploying AI tools at a rapid pace, while many employees lack the skills to use them effectively. We have seen this pattern before. The Industrial Revolution displaced workers who lacked mechanical skills. The digital transformation of the 1990s and 2000s left behind those without computer literacy. Each time, the workers and companies that adapted early came out ahead.</p><p>The AI Action Plan draws attention to this rapidly evolving dynamic and outlines a national strategy that prioritizes AI skills development in federal education and promotes coordination across sectors. Importantly, it provides a pathway for private sector engagement in AI workforce development to deliver benefits in talent retention, innovation capacity, and competitive advantage. In my experience, employees stay with companies that invest in their growth. &mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2026/01/30/trump_has_an_ai_plan_businesses_should_make_theirs_1161971.html>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2026/01/30/trump_has_an_ai_plan_businesses_should_make_theirs_1161971.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
