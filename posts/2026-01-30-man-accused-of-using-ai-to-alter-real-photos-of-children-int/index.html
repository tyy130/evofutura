In this particular case, investigators believe photographs of real children were altered using generative AI to create nude and sexually exploitative images of them.</p><p>The investigation began after the Colorado Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force received information from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) about possible sexual exploitation of a child occurring via the online platform &ldquo;PicsArt.&rdquo;</p><p>PicsArt reported the potential violations to NCMEC after flagging the account and images</p><p>After learning the account was possibly associated with a person in the Boulder County area, the Colorado ICAC sent the tip to county authorities for further investigation.</p><p>As a result of their investigation, a search warrant was served at Fairchild&rsquo;s residence on South 39th Street in Boulder on Jan. 15. They gathered enough evidence through the search to issue an arrest warrant for Fairchild, who turned himself in on Friday.</p><p>If you suspect a child is being sexually exploited online, you can report it online at NCMEC&rsquo;s CyberTipLine website or by calling 1-800-THE-LOST.</p><p><a href=https://www.9news.com/article/news/crime/ai-alter-real-photos-explicit-images/73-5e7cb519-1844-47ba-9cb0-02023c99b5b8>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.9news.com/article/news/crime/ai-alter-real-photos-explicit-images/73-5e7cb519-1844-47ba-9cb0-02023c99b5b8 target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
