This selection reflects the most widely applied and validated machine learning algorithms in the literature for predicting mortar performance. While deep learning (DL) approaches have shown great potential in civil and materials engineering, particularly for image-based tasks like microstructural analysis or crack detection, their methodology differs significantly from conventional ML techniques. DL models, such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks, are designed for high-dimensional, unstructured data, relying on automatic feature extraction rather than predefined input variables. This review focuses on conventional ML methods, which are more applicable to mortar research and allow for easier comparison of performance across studies.</p><p>Other models, including Decision Trees (DT), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and simple regression models, were also reported in the literature, primarily as baseline or exploratory approaches. Among these, DT was the most frequently applied; however, limited details on hyperparameter tuning were generally provided. Consequently, while these models are acknowledged, the detailed analysis focuses on those most extensively applied and documented, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of predictive performance for mortar compressive strength.</p><p>4.1 Artificial Neural Networks</p><p>Artificial Neural Network (ANN) consists of a mathematical and numerical representation replicating the hum&mldr;</p><p><a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-026-10507-9>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11831-026-10507-9 target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
