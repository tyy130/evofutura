Today, I am introducing a topic where AI and its major fields can play a significant role in our overall lives. The world will face numerous substantial challenges in the future, one of the most pressing of which is achieving sustainability through environmental development. AI can be effectively applied to a wide range of environmental challenges, including climate change, energy management, resource optimization, and disaster management, and thus can play a significant role in achieving sustainability in the future. To achieve sustainability by ensuring a safe environment for human civilization, important branches of AI, such as machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, image processing, neural networks, pattern recognition, data science, and knowledge-based engineering, can play a very effective role in formulating short-term, medium-term, and long-term plans and taking practical initiatives.</p><p>Fuel scarcity, energy insufficiency, and the slow transition to renewable energy remain critical global challenges threatening economic stability, environmental sustainability, and equitable development. AI-driven models now enhance long-term energy production forecasting with high accuracy by analysing real-time weather data, historical trends, and environmental factors, thereby reducing uncertainty and supporting the effective integration of renewable energy into the power grid. Machine learning predicts demand surges, enables automated power redistribution, and triggers demand-response actions to prevent grid overloads, reducing reliance on carbon-intensive power plants. Through smart grids, AI uses real-time sensors and algorithms to balance supply and demand, enhancing grid resilience. AI supports environmental pollution monitoring by processing real-time data from IoT air-quality sensors and sat&mldr;</p><p><a href=http://www.daily-sun.com/post-logu/854901>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=http://www.daily-sun.com/post-logu/854901 target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
