On the other hand, the U.S. market is facing uncertainty, particularly due to a decline in inbound tourism in 2025, which has caused some concern for future performance.</p><p>How Are Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) Impacting the Sector?</p><p>One of the most significant shifts identified in the report is the growth of Online Travel Agencies (OTAs), which now account for 37% of all bookings for tours and activities, up from 33% in 2024. This surge reflects the ongoing importance of OTAs in the digital age and their growing dominance in the travel experiences market.</p><p>However, this rise in OTA bookings has come at the expense of direct bookings on operator websites, which have declined from 29% in 2024 to 25% in 2025. The growing reliance on OTAs for customer acquisition has increased costs for operators, who are now facing higher digital marketing expenses and the challenges posed by AI-driven changes in search algorithms, which make customer acquisition more expensive and difficult.</p><p>What Role Is AI Playing in the Travel Experiences Industry?</p><p>Another crucial finding in the report is the acceleration of AI adoption within the travel experiences sector. The study reveals that half of all operators are now actively using or testing AI tools, a significant increase from one-third in 2024. Enterprise operators are leading the charge, with 68% of larger companies using AI for a range of applications, including content creation, internal operations, and customer-facing applications such as chatbots.</p><p>This shift from AI experimentation to impact marks a key transition for the industry, with AI tools increasingly playing a pivotal role in streamlining operations, improving customer service, and personalizing experiences for travelers.</p><p>What Does the Future Hold for the Travel Experiences Sector?</p><p>As the travel experiences sector &mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/arivals-global-operator-landscape-reveals-post-pandemic-growth-and-digital-disruption-in-travel-experiences-key-insights-for-2026/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/arivals-global-operator-landscape-reveals-post-pandemic-growth-and-digital-disruption-in-travel-experiences-key-insights-for-2026/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
