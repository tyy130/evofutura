AI spam could put that story in jeopardy.</p><p>The video platform recently shut down just over a dozen popular accounts that had been churning out AI content &ndash; featuring characters like cats and Jesus &ndash; according to an analysis from Kapwing, a video editing platform. Some of the channels were picking up millions of views before going dark.</p><p>In November, Kapwing published a report that estimated 21% YouTube&rsquo;s feed was AI-generated videos.</p><p>&ldquo;YouTube doesn&rsquo;t allow spam, scams, or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the YouTube community,&rdquo; a YouTube spokesperson said when reached for comment on the removals.</p><p>This month, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said cutting down on low-quality AI content was one of the platform&rsquo;s 2026 priorities.</p><p>&ldquo;To reduce the spread of low-quality AI content, we&rsquo;re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combating spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low-quality, repetitive content,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>YouTube is not against AI.</p><p>Its parent company, Google, is one of the main innovators in AI with products like Veo 3 and Nano Banana.
