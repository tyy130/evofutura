&lt;p&gt;Love it or hate it, AI is now baked into how work gets done. The real advantage isn&amp;rsquo;t just having access to AI tools. It&amp;rsquo;s knowing how to use them well. trAInedup.ai is built for people who feel overwhelmed by the hype but still want practical, usable skills, and its lifetime subscription is $79.99 (MSRP $459).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Open Text in Focus: OTEX stock tests investor conviction as momentum cools and Wall Street recalibra</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-02-01-open-text-in-focus-otex-stock-tests-investor-conviction-as/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 08:01:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-02-01-open-text-in-focus-otex-stock-tests-investor-conviction-as/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;After a strong multi?month run, Open Text&amp;rsquo;s OTEX stock is now moving sideways, caught between AI optimism and integration fatigue from recent acquisitions. Short term traders are watching a tight range, while long term investors are weighing richer valuations against solid cash flows and a maturing cloud strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Text has slipped into that tricky zone where conviction is tested: the story is still promising, the numbers are decent, yet the stock is no longer sprinting higher. OTEX has been trading in a narrow band in recent sessions, with modest intraday swings and a muted tape that suggests investors are pausing to reassess rather than rushing for the exits.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>One in five hospitality businesses used AI last year</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-02-01-one-in-five-hospitality-businesses-used-ai-last-year/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 08:01:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-02-01-one-in-five-hospitality-businesses-used-ai-last-year/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ljubljana, 01 February (STA) - One in five or 19% of Slovenian companies in the catering and accommodation industry used AI technologies last year, just below the EU average of 21%, data published by the Statistics Office shows.

&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated political campaign videos, many without mandatory disclosure labels, are circulating widely on social media ahead of Bangladesh&amp;rsquo;s 13th Parliamentary Election on February 12, according to an extensive investigation by fact-checking organisation Dismislab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 4, a Facebook video showed an elderly man speaking in a crowded marketplace. He said he would vote for the &amp;ldquo;sheaf of paddy&amp;rdquo;, the electoral symbol of the BNP, claiming the party would provide family, agriculture and health cards if elected.

&lt;p&gt;Cities around the world are quickly adopting smart technologies to handle growing populations, complex infrastructure, and environmental challenges. Cameras have long been a part of urban surveillance. However, traditional camera systems mainly serve as passive recording tools, depending on centralized data centers to analyze events after they happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edge AI cameras mark a significant change in this approach. By integrating artificial intelligence into the camera hardware, cities are turning visual data into real-time insights that improve traffic management, public safety, and environmental monitoring, going far beyond simple surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Americans use AI for tax returns, prompting warning from experts | FOX 28 Spokane</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-02-01-americans-use-ai-for-tax-returns-prompting-warning-from-exp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 07:57:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-02-01-americans-use-ai-for-tax-returns-prompting-warning-from-exp/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As the 2026 tax filing season kicks off, some Americans are turning to artificial intelligence to assist with their tax returns.

&lt;p&gt;NAND flash inventory, which had been in oversupply until the first half of last year, has rapidly decreased, causing prices to surge sharply. This is the result of existing NAND leaders Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix focusing on DRAM products such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) amid growing AI demand, leading to reduced NAND production. The semiconductor industry assesses that as the &amp;ldquo;spring of NAND&amp;rdquo; arrives, lower-tier manufacturers are aggressively investing to target the gaps left by Samsung and SK, potentially causing a seismic shift in the NAND market.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>It's more than just the sleek aesthetics that impressed as I tested the AI-enhanced Asus ExpertBook Ultra (2026) business laptop</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-02-01-it-s-more-than-just-the-sleek-aesthetics-that-impressed-as-i/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 07:27:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-02-01-it-s-more-than-just-the-sleek-aesthetics-that-impressed-as-i/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;ASUS ExpertBook Ultra 2026: 30-second review&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Weekly Kyunghyang] #Scene 1. On January 5 (local time), Hyundai Motor Group unveiled the physical AI &amp;lsquo;Atlas&amp;rsquo; at the international home appliance and IT exhibition &amp;lsquo;CES 2026&amp;rsquo; held in Las Vegas, USA. With hands equipped with tactile sensors that enable delicate, human-like tasks, and capable of lifting up to 50㎏, this robot is scheduled to be deployed to automobile production plants in the United States and elsewhere starting in 2028. It will initially work on relatively simple processes such as parts sorting, and from 2030 it plans to expand its scope to tasks such as parts assembly. To that end, the company plans to establish a system capable of mass-producing 30,000 units by 2028. Once Atlas is introduced to factories, humans are said to take on roles of training and managing the robots so they operate well. Amid expectations of a &amp;lsquo;productivity revolution&amp;rsquo;, Hyundai Motor&amp;rsquo;s stock price has surged 80% (as of the January 21 closing price) just since the start of the new year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI-powered penetration testing: Definition, Tools and Process</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-ai-powered-penetration-testing-definition-tools-and-proces/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 22:59:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-ai-powered-penetration-testing-definition-tools-and-proces/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;AI-powered penetration testing is an advanced approach to security testing that uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous agents to simulate real-world cyberattacks, identify vulnerabilities, and assess exploitability faster and more intelligently than traditional manual testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feature engineering for aluminium extrusion dies involves converting geometric information from the engineering drawings or computer-aided design (CAD) models into formats compatible with ML algorithms. A widely adopted approach is direct parametrisation, where geometric dimensions are represented as a set of scalar variables (Chen et al., 2024). Alternatively, sequence-based parametrisation transforms the command sequences used in CAD modelling processes into tensors suitable for ML operations, as proposed by Wu et al. (2021). In this study, both parametrisation methods were applied to represent the geometry of extrusion dies designed for specific solid profiles. These dies are primarily defined by multiple layers of 2D sketches positioned at varying heights and the bearing length distributions, making them well-suited for sequence-based parametrisation. Concurrently, key design parameters influencing die performance were identified and selected for direct parametrisation, thereby establishing a structured mapping between design variables and performance outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How AI is bringing the dead back and what that means for the living</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-how-ai-is-bringing-the-dead-back-and-what-that-means-for-the/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 21:26:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-how-ai-is-bringing-the-dead-back-and-what-that-means-for-the/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;MEDIA AND cultural researcher Tom Divon.

Most AI-enabled CDSS remain at the proof-of-concept stage, with retrospective, single-center data dominating the literature. External validation, interpretability, and integration into PAT clinical workflows are rare. Importantly, the practical value of AI-enabled CDSS will differ across health systems: settings without stable electronic health records, reliable connectivity, or analytic support &amp;ndash; in particular many low- and middle-income or financially constrained hospitals &amp;ndash; may struggle to implement complex algorithms within their clinical information systems, risking a widening digital divide in perioperative care. This scoping review therefore aims to synthesize evidence from 2020 to 2025 on AI-enabled CDSS for preoperative assessment and risk stratification within PAT, map dominant approaches, highlight gaps in implementation, and identify opportunities for translation into routine perioperative care. We therefore focus on AI-enabled CDSS that inform preadmission decision-making and perioperative workflows in PAT. We include AI-CDSS evaluated within preadmission testing or preoperative evaluation clinics (PAT-embedded) and tools developed outside PAT but whose outputs directly inform preoperative risk stratification, triage, test stewardship, or planning (PAT-informative). The review protocol was preregistered on the Open Science Framework under a broader &amp;lsquo;digital determinants of health&amp;rsquo; umbrella, and the scope was refined &amp;ndash; prior to full data extraction &amp;ndash; to concentrate on AI-enabled CDSS for feasibility and depth (see Methods for details).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why driverless cars aren't the upgrade London thinks they are</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-why-driverless-cars-aren-t-the-upgrade-london-thinks-they-ar/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 19:27:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-why-driverless-cars-aren-t-the-upgrade-london-thinks-they-ar/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Autonomous cars are coming to London!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;UK to be European leader in driverless tech!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

Such material could potentially extend the parallelism and speed of wave computing to the learning process, enabling the use of physical phenomena to train machine learning models. However, realizing self-learning in metamaterials is a significant challenge. This is because a self-learning material is tasked with solving two simultaneous problems24: On one hand, the material performs a direct problem on the input signals. This direct problem can be, for example, solving a classification task. On the other hand, the material is also performing an inverse problem, autonomously adapting its parameters to improve its fitness in response to new examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Not ready for robots in homes?

These agents can ask questions, respond to others, upvote posts, and create their own topic-focused communities known as submolts - very similar to reddit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Amazon's 16,000 Job Cuts Signal Deepening Transformation Beyond Cost-Cutting</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-amazon-s-16000-job-cuts-signal-deepening-transformation-bey/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 14:10:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-amazon-s-16000-job-cuts-signal-deepening-transformation-bey/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon&amp;rsquo;s decision to eliminate 16,000 positions represents far more than another round of corporate belt-tightening.

Explore the top 7 AI orchestration tools for enterprises in 2026 that help coordinate models, automate pipelines, and manage AI lifecycle processes efficiently. This guide highlights core capabilities, integration options, and how these platforms support reliable, compliant, and scalable AI operations across teams and environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI adoption has moved rapidly from experimentation to large-scale deployment, making AI orchestration mission-critical for enterprises in 2026. Generative AI models, AI agents, and machine learning pipelines are now embedded across customer service, finance, engineering, and internal operations. However, this growth has also led to GenAI sprawl, including multiple models, workflows, and tools operating in silos, often without standard governance or monitoring. As a result, many enterprises struggle with rising costs, unreliable AI pipelines, and production failures.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Top 10 robotics developments of January 2026</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-top-10-robotics-developments-of-january-2026/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 13:48:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-top-10-robotics-developments-of-january-2026/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The robotics industry hit the ground running in January 2026.

However, their comparative effectiveness remains controversial, with previous meta-analyses confounded by the inclusion of retrospective cohort studies. No systematic synthesis has exclusively evaluated prospective randomized controlled trials with formal GRADE certainty assessments. To compare the perioperative, postoperative, and economic outcomes of da Vinci robotic versus laparoscopic adrenalectomy for adrenal neoplasms through GRADE-assessed meta-analysis restricted to prospective randomized trials. This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD420251276037) on December 27, 2025. A systematic literature search (inception to December 2025) was performed to identify prospective randomized trials comparing robotic and laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Two independent reviewers performed the screening, extraction, and Cochrane RoB 2. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool operative time, blood loss, conversion, length of stay, complications, and cost. Heterogeneity was assessed using I² with pre-specified sensitivity and subgroup analyses. The GRADE system was used to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. Three randomized trials (n = 214 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Robotic adrenalectomy showed no statistically significant difference compared with laparoscopy in terms of operative time (MD 14.88 min, 95% CI - 25.18 to 54.95; P = 0.47; I²=94%; very low certainty), hospital stay (MD 0.04 days, 95% CI - 0.29 to 0.38; P = 0.80; I²=0%; low certainty), conversion rates (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.05 to 10.58; P = 0.81; I²=60%; very low certainty), postoperative complications (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.69 to 3.36; P = 0.30; I²=0%; low certainty), or total costs (MD $2444.02, 95% CI -$906.62 to 5794.66; P = 0.15; I²=99%; very low certainty)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PhD Position in Multimodal Learning</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-phd-position-in-multimodal-learning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 03:05:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-phd-position-in-multimodal-learning/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Data Science and Knowledge Discovery Department (DataSci) at Simula Metropolitan Center for Digital Engineering (Oslo, Norway) is looking for a highly-motivated, self-driven and curious PhD student with a strong background in numerical linear algebra and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

A combination of hardware and a software stack that can serve as a smart assistant for drivers &amp;ndash; different from ADAS technology &amp;ndash; attracted several curious visitors. This particular technology can send alerts from vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure to inform a driver about obstacles on the road. In contrast, ADAS tech depends on sensors and cameras to alert a driver and also takes over control from the latter to apply brakes. &amp;ldquo;The showcased intelligent technology stack has a range of 900m to 1km and can be fitted on older versions of cars that do not have ADAS,&amp;rdquo; a booth representative of the company that developed the technology told TOI. Secondly, the expo also showcased an autonomous mobile robot designed to tow a payload of up to 100kg that has a maximum speed of 8km per hour. The robotic technology has uses in the logistics and warehousing segment, representatives informed. Amongst other items on display was a sodium-ion battery developed by Vilas Shelke with support from the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL). These batteries can serve as a substitute for lithium-ion batteries. At present, India is dependent on imports of cobalt, nickel and lithium from other countries. &amp;ldquo;In contrast, India has large reserves of sodium, and it is also obtained from seawater. The manufacturing process for this battery will be carried out entirely in India. This battery does not catch fire, and ARAI tested it at 120 degrees Celsius,&amp;rdquo; Shelke said. The sodium-ion batteries developed by Shelke will be used in two-wheelers in about nine months in the first phase, followed by three- and four-wheelers. Shelke also said he has plans to set up manufacturing for the same in the city.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>India, France Frame AI Impact Summit As Global South Milestone | World</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-india-france-frame-ai-impact-summit-as-global-south-milesto/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 02:33:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-31-india-france-frame-ai-impact-summit-as-global-south-milesto/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Washington: India and France presented the upcoming AI Impact Summit in New Delhi as a turning point in global artificial intelligence governance, with a focus on inclusion, development, and real-world outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Korea Keeps Nuclear Expansion on Track&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea is proceeding with plans to build two new large nuclear reactors as outlined in its 11 Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand, which was finalized in early 2025. Korea Hydro &amp;amp; Nuclear Power (KHNP) has opened a bidding process for local governments to host the reactors, which would have a combined capacity of 2.8 gigawatts electric (GWe) and are slated for completion by 2038. KHNP plans to select the site by 2027 and obtain construction permits in the early 2030s in order to meet that timeline. While President Lee Jae-myung has opposed nuclear new builds, arguing that building new reactors is unrealistic given the long construction timelines, he has supported the continued use of reactors that are already online or under construction, of which there are three. From a US-South Korea partnership perspective, the decision to continue new nuclear construction matters as maintaining an active construction program reinforces South Korea&amp;rsquo;s technical expertise, supply chain capacity, and credibility as a partner for joint nuclear projects and exports.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lead AI Solutions Architect on Microsoft Azure</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-lead-ai-solutions-architect-on-microsoft-azure/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 23:26:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-lead-ai-solutions-architect-on-microsoft-azure/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Seeking a Lead AI Solutions Architect to design, build, and deploy production-grade AI solutions on Microsoft Azure.

She&amp;rsquo;s done bird dance with her loved ones since she was 7 years old &amp;ndash; an act, she said, not only of spirituality but also of perseverance, since bird dance is among the acts of Native American culture nearly eradicated by colonization and U.S. government policy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Global Privacy Watchlist</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-global-privacy-watchlist/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 23:22:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-global-privacy-watchlist/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The global data privacy and online safety landscape is undergoing a period of unprecedented regulatory transformation.

&lt;p&gt;To what extent can an artificial system be rational?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new MIT course, 6.S044/24.S00 (AI and Rationality), doesn&amp;rsquo;t seek to answer this question. Instead, it challenges students to explore this and other philosophical problems through the lens of AI research. For the next generation of scholars, concepts of rationality and agency could prove integral in AI decision-making, especially when influenced by how humans understand their own cognitive limits and their constrained, subjective views of what is or isn&amp;rsquo;t rational.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I replaced Microsoft Paint with a powerful open-source alternative</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-i-replaced-microsoft-paint-with-a-powerful-open-source-alter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 21:53:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-i-replaced-microsoft-paint-with-a-powerful-open-source-alter/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Nick Lewis is an editor at How-To Geek.

&lt;p&gt;Interviewed by John Battelle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Forté has made his home on Martha&amp;rsquo;s Vineyard for nearly a decade, but he&amp;rsquo;s been in love with the Island since his first visit back in 1998, when he came with a friend who just happened to be Ben Taylor, son of Island legends Carly Simon and James Taylor. Beyond a star turn with the Fugees and releasing four albums of his own, Forté has collaborated with a broad spectrum of musical talent, many of them household names &amp;ndash; beyond Simon and Ben Taylor, he&amp;rsquo;s worked with Herbie Hancock, DMX, and even Michael Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Nordic Blueprint for Building A.I.

&lt;p&gt;Rakers blames a report from independent research and analysis company SemiAnalysis, which covers semiconductors in general and artificial intelligence in particular, for AMD&amp;rsquo;s sudden decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you&amp;rsquo;re probably aware, AMD is trying to break into the AI market that Nvidia (NVDA 1.41%) currently dominates. AMD says its &amp;ldquo;MI350 Series GPUs set a new standard for Generative AI and high performance computing (HPC) in data centers,&amp;rdquo; and its upcoming MI450 chip will be even better.

Instead of another screen, it leans into voice, vision, and context, clipping discreetly to clothing for hands-free interaction. Designed as an iPhone companion rather than a replacement, the Apple AI Pin raises a practical question: does removing the screen make everyday tasks easier, or just more awkward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early details point to a wearable that listens, sees, and responds instantly without pulling a phone from your pocket. Apple AI aims to make interactions feel ambient rather than deliberate.

Today, I am introducing a topic where AI and its major fields can play a significant role in our overall lives. The world will face numerous substantial challenges in the future, one of the most pressing of which is achieving sustainability through environmental development. AI can be effectively applied to a wide range of environmental challenges, including climate change, energy management, resource optimization, and disaster management, and thus can play a significant role in achieving sustainability in the future. To achieve sustainability by ensuring a safe environment for human civilization, important branches of AI, such as machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, image processing, neural networks, pattern recognition, data science, and knowledge-based engineering, can play a very effective role in formulating short-term, medium-term, and long-term plans and taking practical initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Arms Race Intensifies: How AI Systems Are Revolutionizing Cybersecurity Vulnerability Detection</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-the-arms-race-intensifies-how-ai-systems-are-revolutionizin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:38:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-the-arms-race-intensifies-how-ai-systems-are-revolutionizin/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The cybersecurity industry stands at an inflection point as artificial intelligence systems demonstrate unprecedented capabilities in identifying and exploiting software vulnerabilities, fundamentally altering the dynamics between attackers and defenders. Recent developments suggest that AI-powered tools are not merely augmenting human capabilities but potentially surpassing them in certain critical areas of security research, raising profound questions about the future of digital defense strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Schneier on Security, machine learning models have achieved remarkable progress in automated vulnerability discovery, with some systems now capable of identifying zero-day exploits faster than traditional security teams. Bruce Schneier notes that this technological leap represents more than incremental improvement &amp;ndash; it signals a fundamental shift in how security vulnerabilities will be discovered, analyzed, and potentially weaponized in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Is This the Robot Equivalent of Walking While Chewing Gum?</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-is-this-the-robot-equivalent-of-walking-while-chewing-gum/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:33:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-is-this-the-robot-equivalent-of-walking-while-chewing-gum/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Westwood Robotics is proud to announce a major update: THEMIS Gen2.5, the world&amp;rsquo;s first commercial full-size humanoid robot capable of manipulation on the move!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core capabilities of a warehouse management system (WMS) is its put-away engine. A put-away engine allows warehouses to model the business logic that determines where each product should be stored at the time it is received into the warehouse. Every WMS provides the ability to configure put-away rules, and during put-away execution, those rules are evaluated to determine the correct destination bin. When rules do not return a valid result, the system either presents an error or defaults to a fallback bin.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lloyds Projects £100M Value From AI in 2026 - TechRepublic</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-lloyds-projects-ps100m-value-from-ai-in-2026-techrepublic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:28:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-lloyds-projects-ps100m-value-from-ai-in-2026-techrepublic/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This update underscores how one of the UK&amp;rsquo;s largest banking groups is moving beyond experimentation with AI and into large-scale deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservative treatment for chronic non-specific low back pain (CLBP) includes lumbar extension traction (LET) to re-align lumbar lordosis (LL). This study explores the use of machine learning (ML) models to predict post-treatment outcomes in patients with CLBP undergoing LET and how these predictions can support clinical decision-making. We utilized a retrospective database of 431 consecutive patients with uncomplicated CLBP. Post-treatment variables predicted included LL, NRS pain score, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Input model variables included pre-treatment LL, sacral base angle (SBA), ratio of LL/SBA fit type, NRS, ODI, frequency, duration, LET compliance, and demographic variables of age and BMI. Initial variables were analyzed to predict post-treatment outcomes. Three ML models &amp;ndash; Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) &amp;ndash; were employed to handle both continuous and categorical variables, and performance was evaluated for predictive accuracy. Factors affecting outcomes were identified using Shapley Additive Explanations. Treatment was a multimodal spine rehabilitation program featuring LET applied 3-6 times per week, varied between 4 and 10 weeks, and follow-up was performed at the end of care. Improvements in LL, NRS, and ODI were - 11.5° to - 23.6°, 7.3/10 to 3.3/10, and 33.2% to 10.4%, respectively. Among the ML models, XGBoost demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy for lumbar lordotic angle (R = 0.728) and pain score (R = 0.648), while Random Forest slightly outperformed XGBoost for ODI (0.631 vs. 0.616). MLP performed poorly for ODI predictions (R = 0.201), indicating difficulty in capturing functional disability patterns.

&lt;p&gt;Besides being one of the most effective modes of commercial communication, email has become the most exploited attack surface for enterprises. High-tech phishing campaigns now use AI-generated, highly contextual content, which is often indistinguishable from legitimate commercial communication. Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks impersonate real executives, suppliers, and finance teams, while malicious content is increasingly remain hidden in links, QR codes, and cloud file shares. Industry reports indicate that over 80% of phishing emails in 2025 contained AI-generated text, significantly increasing detection challenges.

&lt;p&gt;Tesla&amp;rsquo;s plan has been very different from the strategies of companies like Alphabet/Waymo, GM/Cruise, Amazon/Zoox, Baidu Apollo and others. These teams have taken a make-it-work first approach, using whatever hardware necessary, expecting the cost of the hardware to plummet with time and scale as is generally the case for digital electronics.

&lt;p&gt;The present section provides a comprehensive discussion of the most frequently used models for predicting mortar mechanical properties, as summarized in Table 2. This selection reflects the most widely applied and validated machine learning algorithms in the literature for predicting mortar performance. While deep learning (DL) approaches have shown great potential in civil and materials engineering, particularly for image-based tasks like microstructural analysis or crack detection, their methodology differs significantly from conventional ML techniques. DL models, such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks, are designed for high-dimensional, unstructured data, relying on automatic feature extraction rather than predefined input variables. This review focuses on conventional ML methods, which are more applicable to mortar research and allow for easier comparison of performance across studies.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Abstracting Robot Manipulation Skills via Mixture-of-Experts Diffusion Policies</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-abstracting-robot-manipulation-skills-via-mixture-of-experts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-abstracting-robot-manipulation-skills-via-mixture-of-experts/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21251v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: Diffusion-based policies have recently shown strong results in robot manipulation, but their extension to multi-task scenarios is hindered by the high cost of scaling model size and demonstrations. We introduce Skill Mixture-of-Experts Policy (SMP), a diffusion-based mixture-of-experts policy that learns a compact orthogonal skill basis and uses sticky routing to compose actions from a small, task-relevant subset of experts at each step. A variational training objective supports this design, and adaptive expert activation at inference yields fast sampling without oversized backbones. We validate SMP in simulation and on a real dual-arm platform with multi-task learning and transfer learning tasks, where SMP achieves higher success rates and markedly lower inference cost than large diffusion baselines. These results indicate a practical path toward scalable, transferable multi-task manipulation: learn reusable skills once, activate only what is needed, and adapt quickly when tasks change.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Deep QP Safety Filter: Model-free Learning for Reachability-based Safety Filter</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-deep-qp-safety-filter-model-free-learning-for-reachability/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-deep-qp-safety-filter-model-free-learning-for-reachability/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21297v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: We introduce Deep QP Safety Filter, a fully data-driven safety layer for black-box dynamical systems. Our method learns a Quadratic-Program (QP) safety filter without model knowledge by combining Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability with model-free learning. We construct contraction-based losses for both the safety value and its derivatives, and train two neural networks accordingly. In the exact setting, the learned critic converges to the viscosity solution (and its derivative), even for non-smooth values. Across diverse dynamical systems &amp;ndash; even including a hybrid system &amp;ndash; and multiple RL tasks, Deep QP Safety Filter substantially reduces pre-convergence failures while accelerating learning toward higher returns than strong baselines, offering a principled and practical route to safe, model-free control.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Disturbance-Aware Flight Control of Robotic Gliding Blimp via Moving Mass Actuation</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-disturbance-aware-flight-control-of-robotic-gliding-blimp-vi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-disturbance-aware-flight-control-of-robotic-gliding-blimp-vi/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21188v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: Robotic blimps, as lighter-than-air (LTA) aerial systems, offer long endurance and inherently safe operation but remain highly susceptible to wind disturbances. Building on recent advances in moving mass actuation, this paper addresses the lack of disturbance-aware control frameworks for LTA platforms by explicitly modeling and compensating for wind-induced effects. A moving horizon estimator (MHE) infers real-time wind perturbations and provides these estimates to a model predictive controller (MPC), enabling robust trajectory and heading regulation under varying wind conditions. The proposed approach leverages a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) moving-mass mechanism to generate both inertial and aerodynamic moments for attitude and heading control, thereby enhancing flight stability in disturbance-prone environments. Extensive flight experiments under headwind and crosswind conditions show that the integrated MHE-MPC framework significantly outperforms baseline PID control, demonstrating its effectiveness for disturbance-aware LTA flight.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>HPTune: Hierarchical Proactive Tuning for Collision-Free Model Predictive Control</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-hptune-hierarchical-proactive-tuning-for-collision-free-mod/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-hptune-hierarchical-proactive-tuning-for-collision-free-mod/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21346v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: Parameter tuning is a powerful approach to enhance adaptability in model predictive control (MPC) motion planners. However, existing methods typically operate in a myopic fashion that only evaluates executed actions, leading to inefficient parameter updates due to the sparsity of failure events (e.g., obstacle nearness or collision). To cope with this issue, we propose to extend evaluation from executed to non-executed actions, yielding a hierarchical proactive tuning (HPTune) framework that combines both a fast-level tuning and a slow-level tuning. The fast one adopts risk indicators of predictive closing speed and predictive proximity distance, and the slow one leverages an extended evaluation loss for closed-loop backpropagation. Additionally, we integrate HPTune with the Doppler LiDAR that provides obstacle velocities apart from position-only measurements for enhanced motion predictions, thus facilitating the implementation of HPTune. Extensive experiments on high-fidelity simulator demonstrate that HPTune achieves efficient MPC tuning and outperforms various baseline schemes in complex environments. It is found that HPTune enables situation-tailored motion planning by formulating a safe, agile collision avoidance strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>InspecSafe-V1: A Multimodal Benchmark for Safety Assessment in Industrial Inspection Scenarios</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-inspecsafe-v1-a-multimodal-benchmark-for-safety-assessment/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-inspecsafe-v1-a-multimodal-benchmark-for-safety-assessment/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21173v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: With the rapid development of industrial intelligence and unmanned inspection, reliable perception and safety assessment for AI systems in complex and dynamic industrial sites has become a key bottleneck for deploying predictive maintenance and autonomous inspection. Most public datasets remain limited by simulated data sources, single-modality sensing, or the absence of fine-grained object-level annotations, which prevents robust scene understanding and multimodal safety reasoning for industrial foundation models. To address these limitations, InspecSafe-V1 is released as the first multimodal benchmark dataset for industrial inspection safety assessment that is collected from routine operations of real inspection robots in real-world environments. InspecSafe-V1 covers five representative industrial scenarios, including tunnels, power facilities, sintering equipment, oil and gas petrochemical plants, and coal conveyor trestles. The dataset is constructed from 41 wheeled and rail-mounted inspection robots operating at 2,239 valid inspection sites, yielding 5,013 inspection instances. For each instance, pixel-level segmentation annotations are provided for key objects in visible-spectrum images. In addition, a semantic scene description and a corresponding safety level label are provided according to practical inspection tasks. Seven synchronized sensing modalities are further included, including infrared video, audio, depth point clouds, radar point clouds, gas measurements, temperature, and humidity, to support multimodal anomaly recognition, cross-modal fusion, and comprehensive safety assessment in industrial environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Meta-ROS: A Next-Generation Middleware Architecture for Adaptive and Scalable Robotic Systems</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-meta-ros-a-next-generation-middleware-architecture-for-adap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-meta-ros-a-next-generation-middleware-architecture-for-adap/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21011v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: The field of robotics faces significant challenges related to the complexity and interoperability of existing middleware frameworks, like ROS2, which can be difficult for new developers to adopt. To address these issues, we propose Meta-ROS, a novel middleware solution designed to streamline robotics development by simplifying integration, enhancing performance, and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Meta-ROS leverages modern communication protocols, such as Zenoh and ZeroMQ, to enable efficient and low-latency communication across diverse hardware platforms, while also supporting various data types like audio, images, and video. We evaluated Meta-ROS&amp;rsquo;s performance through comprehensive testing, comparing it with existing middleware frameworks like ROS1 and ROS2. The results demonstrated that Meta-ROS outperforms ROS2, achieving up to 30% higher throughput, significantly reducing message latency, and optimizing resource usage. Additionally, its robust hardware support and developer-centric design facilitate seamless integration and ease of use, positioning Meta-ROS as an ideal solution for modern, real-time robotics AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Multi-Robot Decentralized Collaborative SLAM in Planetary Analogue Environments: Dataset, Challenges, and Lessons Learned</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-multi-robot-decentralized-collaborative-slam-in-planetary-an/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-multi-robot-decentralized-collaborative-slam-in-planetary-an/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21063v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: Decentralized collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping (C-SLAM) is essential to enable multirobot missions in unknown environments without relying on preexisting localization and communication infrastructure. This technology is anticipated to play a key role in the exploration of the Moon, Mars, and other planets. In this article, we share insights and lessons learned from C-SLAM experiments involving three robots operating on a Mars analogue terrain and communicating over an ad hoc network. We examine the impact of limited and intermittent communication on C-SLAM performance, as well as the unique localization challenges posed by planetary-like environments. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset collected during our experiments, which includes real-time peer-to-peer inter-robot throughput and latency measurements. This dataset aims to support future research on communication-constrained, decentralized multirobot operations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Quick Heuristic Validation of Edges in Dynamic Roadmap Graphs</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-quick-heuristic-validation-of-edges-in-dynamic-roadmap-graph/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-quick-heuristic-validation-of-edges-in-dynamic-roadmap-graph/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.20968v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of adjusting roadmap graphs for robot motion planning to non-static environments. We introduce the &amp;ldquo;Red-Green-Gray&amp;rdquo; paradigm, a modification of the SPITE method, capable of classifying the validity status of nodes and edges using cheap heuristic checks, allowing fast semi-lazy roadmap updates. Given a roadmap, we use simple computational geometry methods to approximate the swept volumes of robots and perform lazy collision checks, and label a subset of the edges as invalid (red), valid (green), or unknown (gray). We present preliminary experimental results comparing our method to the well-established technique of Leven and Hutchinson, and showing increased accuracy as well as the ability to correctly label edges as invalid while maintaining comparable update runtimes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Track-centric Iterative Learning for Global Trajectory Optimization in Autonomous Racing</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-track-centric-iterative-learning-for-global-trajectory-optim/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-track-centric-iterative-learning-for-global-trajectory-optim/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21027v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: This paper presents a global trajectory optimization framework for minimizing lap time in autonomous racing under uncertain vehicle dynamics. Optimizing the trajectory over the full racing horizon is computationally expensive, and tracking such a trajectory in the real world hardly assures global optimality due to uncertain dynamics. Yet, existing work mostly focuses on dynamics learning at the tracking level, without updating the trajectory itself to account for the learned dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a track-centric approach that directly learns and optimizes the full-horizon trajectory. We first represent trajectories through a track-agnostic parametric space in light of the wavelet transform. This space is then efficiently explored using Bayesian optimization, where the lap time of each candidate is evaluated by running simulations with the learned dynamics. This optimization is embedded in an iterative learning framework, where the optimized trajectory is deployed to collect real-world data for updating the dynamics, progressively refining the trajectory over the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating lap time improvement of up to 20.7% over a nominal baseline and consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>WheelArm-Sim: A Manipulation and Navigation Combined Multimodal Synthetic Data Generation Simulator for Unified Control in Assistive Robotics</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-wheelarm-sim-a-manipulation-and-navigation-combined-multimo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-30-wheelarm-sim-a-manipulation-and-navigation-combined-multimo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;arXiv:2601.21129v1 Announce Type: new
Abstract: Wheelchairs and robotic arms enhance independent living by assisting individuals with upper-body and mobility limitations in their activities of daily living (ADLs). Although recent advancements in assistive robotics have focused on Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arms (WMRAs) and wheelchairs separately, integrated and unified control of the combination using machine learning models remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of WheelArm, an integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) that combines wheelchair and robotic arm controls. Data collection is the first step toward developing WheelArm models. In this paper, we present WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection. We evaluate its capability by collecting a manipulation and navigation combined multimodal dataset, comprising 13 tasks, 232 trajectories, and 67,783 samples. To demonstrate the potential of the WheelArm dataset, we implement a baseline model for action prediction in the mustard-picking task. The results illustrate that data collected from WheelArm-Sim is feasible for a data-driven machine learning model for integrated control.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Project Genie: Experimenting with infinite, interactive worlds</title><link>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-29-project-genie-experimenting-with-infinite-interactive-worl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:01:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tyy130.github.io/evofutura/posts/2026-01-29-project-genie-experimenting-with-infinite-interactive-worl/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. can try out Project Genie, an experimental research prototype that lets you create and explore worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
