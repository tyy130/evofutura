In one, a single radiologist was assisted by an AI system to check the scans.</p><p>The other followed the standard European method, which requires two radiologists to read the scans.</p><p>Nine percent more cancer cases were spotted in the AI group compared to the control group.</p><p>Over the following two years, those in the AI group also had a 12 percent lower rate of being diagnosed with cancer between routine scans, which are known as interval cancers and can be particularly dangerous.</p><p>The improvement was consistent across different ages and levels of breast density, which can be risk factors. The rate of false positives was similar in both groups.</p><p>Senior study author Kristina Lang of Sweden&rsquo;s Lund University said that &ldquo;widely rolling out AI-supported mammography in breast cancer screening programmes could help reduce workload pressures amongst radiologists, as well as helping to detect more cancers at an early stage&rdquo;.</p><p>But this must be done &ldquo;cautiously&rdquo; and with &ldquo;continuous monitoring&rdquo;, she said in a statement.</p><p>Jean-Philippe Masson, head of the French National Federation of Radiologists, told AFP that &ldquo;the radiologist&rsquo;s eye and experi&mldr;</p><p><a href="https://punchng.com/?p=2050538">Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href="https://punchng.com/?p=2050538" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the original article →</a></aside><section class=related-articles><h2>More Articles</h2><div class=related-grid><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-federal-cio-outlines-one-government-blueprint-for-overhaul/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805679/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/federal-cio-outlines-one-government-blueprint-fo.jpg alt="AI helps doctors detect more breast cancer cases in landmark trial" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>Federal CIO outlines 'one government' blueprint for …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-the-best-ai-stock-that-nobody-s-talking-about-for-2026/><div class=related-card-content><h3>The Best AI Stock That Nobody's Talking About for 2026</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-buzz-about-broadcom-s-custom-chips-is-testing-but-not-break/><div class=related-card-content><h3>Buzz about Broadcom's custom chips is testing, but not …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a></div></section></article><script>(function(){const e=document.getElementById("reading-progress");if(!e)return;function t(){const n=window.scrollY,t=document.documentElement.scrollHeight-window.innerHeight,s=t>0?n/t*100:0;e.style.width=Math.min(100,s)+"%"}window.addEventListener("scroll",t,{passive:!0}),t()})()</script></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
