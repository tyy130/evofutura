All three teams will advance to a citywide tournament later this year.</p><p>This year&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;Unearthed,&rdquo; challenged participants to prepare months in advance in collaboration with NYC FIRST, an organization that empowers students from diverse communities across New York City to engage with STEM and robotics.</p><p>Using LEGO SPIKE robotics and creative problem-solving, participants aged 9 to 17 built robots to remove topsoil and uncover hidden treasures, excavate heavy objects, recover artifacts, and reconstruct statues and other structures. Along the way, they learned valuable communication skills, including teamwork, conflict resolution, respect, and empathy.</p><p>The library system, which houses five teen tech centers at Kings Highway, Saratoga, Adams Street, Crown Heights, and Bay Ridge Libraries, offers the BKLYN Robotics League as part of a broader suite of programs. Patrons of all ages can explore science and technology through programs such as T4, a technology internship for teens; free computer basics courses; and advanced workshops in motion graphics, audio editing, 3D printing, AI, and more.</p><p>BPL President and CEO Linda Johnson thanked the parents, volunteers, librarians, and staff who helped the teams thrive, praising the &ldquo;inventive&rdquo; participants.</p><p>&ldquo;The BKLYN Robotics League provides children and teens the opportunity to not only learn about building and programming robots, but also &mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/brookln-public-library-robotics-championship/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.brooklynpaper.com/brookln-public-library-robotics-championship/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the original article →</a></aside><section class=related-articles><h2>More Articles</h2><div class=related-grid><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-in-the-ai-age-aeur-slow-and-steadyaeurtm-doesnaeurtmt-really-win/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805108/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/in-the-ai-age-aeur-slow-and-steadyaeurtm-doesnaeurtmt-rea.jpg alt="Irving Hawks take top prize at Brooklyn Public Library Robotics League championship * Brooklyn Paper" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>In the AI age, â€~slow and steadyâ€™ doesnâ€™t really win</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-mito-ai-4-5-million-pre-seed-funding-closed-for-collaborat/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805110/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/mito-ai-4-5-million-pre-seed-funding-closed-for.jpg alt="Irving Hawks take top prize at Brooklyn Public Library Robotics League championship * Brooklyn Paper" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>MITO AI: $4.5 Million Pre-Seed Funding Closed For …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-why-ai-doesn-t-think-like-humans-how-its-unique-strength/><div class=related-card-content><h3>Why AI Doesn't Think Like Humans -- How Its Unique Strength …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a></div></section></article><script>(function(){const e=document.getElementById("reading-progress");if(!e)return;function t(){const n=window.scrollY,t=document.documentElement.scrollHeight-window.innerHeight,s=t>0?n/t*100:0;e.style.width=Math.min(100,s)+"%"}window.addEventListener("scroll",t,{passive:!0}),t()})()</script></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
