People have long been interested in understanding themselves better. Online personality questionnaires, some valid and many of dubious quality, are enormously popular.&rdquo;</p><p>Researchers looked into whether AI programs like ChatGPT and Claude can act like general &ldquo;judges&rdquo; of personality. To test this, they had the AI read people&rsquo;s own words-either short daily video diaries or longer recordings of what happened to be on their mind-and asked it to answer personality questions the way each person would. The study included stories and thoughts from more than 160 people collected in real-life and lab settings.</p><p>The results showed that the AI&rsquo;s personality scores were very similar to how people rated themselves, and often matched them better than ratings from friends or family. Older text-analysis methods did not perform nearly as well as these newer AI systems.</p><p>&ldquo;We were taken aback by just how strong these associations were, given how different these two data sources are,&rdquo; Wright said.</p><p>AI&rsquo;s personality ratings could also predict real parts of people&rsquo;s lives, like their emotions, stress levels, social behavior and even whether they had been diagnosed with mental health conditions or sought treatment, according to the findings.</p><p>This research indicates that personality nat&mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.miragenews.com/ai-analyzes-speech-to-uncover-personality-traits-1611364/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.miragenews.com/ai-analyzes-speech-to-uncover-personality-traits-1611364/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
