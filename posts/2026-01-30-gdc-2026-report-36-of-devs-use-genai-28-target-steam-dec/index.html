Not ideal for a comparison to last year&rsquo;s survey, as there was a drop from 3,000 people surveyed in 2025 but still an interesting insight into the health of the industry.</p><p>Starting with the rough side of things, sadly their data shows 11% of people survey were laid off in the last 24 months, and 17% were laid off in the last 12 months. 41% of those laid off were as a result of their studio being acquired, 63% because the studio closed and 13% due to mergers.</p><p>And now of course onto generative AI, because it&rsquo;s a hot topic right now. 36% of participants noted they&rsquo;re using generative AI as part of their job.That number only increases when the participants talked about the company they work for as a whole with 52% saying their company is using generative AI. Who use it varies based on the role as noted in the survey:</p><p>Respondents at game studios reported using AI tools (30%) less than those at publishing companies, support</p><p>teams, and marketing/PR firms (58%). Business professionals&rsquo; usage (58%) far outweighs most other job disciplines.</p><p>And upper management (47%) uses AI tools more than those in the lower decks (29%). Studio directors (36%) sit</p><p>between the two groups.</p><p>As for what tools people are using, ChatGPT came out on top at 74%:</p><p>As for the impact generative AI has? 52% said they felt it had a negative impact on the gaming industry. With those working in technical arts, game design and narrative, and game programming having the most unfavourable views on it. Only around 7% of respondents felt it was having a positive impact.</p><p>Onto game engines from the survey 42% are using Unreal Engine, 30% on Unity, 19% on some other proprietary / in-house game engine and 5% use Godot.</p><p>For what platforms developers are working on / optimising for, this is where it gets quite interesting. PC remains the default for mo&mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gdc-2026-report-36pct-of-devs-use-genai-28pct-target-steam-deck-and-8pct-target-linux/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gdc-2026-report-36pct-of-devs-use-genai-28pct-target-steam-deck-and-8pct-target-linux/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
