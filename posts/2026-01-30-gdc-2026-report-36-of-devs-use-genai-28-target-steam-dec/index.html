Not ideal for a comparison to last year&rsquo;s survey, as there was a drop from 3,000 people surveyed in 2025 but still an interesting insight into the health of the industry.</p><p>Starting with the rough side of things, sadly their data shows 11% of people survey were laid off in the last 24 months, and 17% were laid off in the last 12 months. 41% of those laid off were as a result of their studio being acquired, 63% because the studio closed and 13% due to mergers.</p><p>And now of course onto generative AI, because it&rsquo;s a hot topic right now. 36% of participants noted they&rsquo;re using generative AI as part of their job.That number only increases when the participants talked about the company they work for as a whole with 52% saying their company is using generative AI. Who use it varies based on the role as noted in the survey:</p><p>Respondents at game studios reported using AI tools (30%) less than those at publishing companies, support</p><p>teams, and marketing/PR firms (58%). Business professionals&rsquo; usage (58%) far outweighs most other job disciplines.</p><p>And upper management (47%) uses AI tools more than those in the lower decks (29%). Studio directors (36%) sit</p><p>between the two groups.</p><p>As for what tools people are using, ChatGPT came out on top at 74%:</p><p>As for the impact generative AI has? 52% said they felt it had a negative impact on the gaming industry. With those working in technical arts, game design and narrative, and game programming having the most unfavourable views on it. Only around 7% of respondents felt it was having a positive impact.</p><p>Onto game engines from the survey 42% are using Unreal Engine, 30% on Unity, 19% on some other proprietary / in-house game engine and 5% use Godot.</p><p>For what platforms developers are working on / optimising for, this is where it gets quite interesting. PC remains the default for mo&mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gdc-2026-report-36pct-of-devs-use-genai-28pct-target-steam-deck-and-8pct-target-linux/>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gdc-2026-report-36pct-of-devs-use-genai-28pct-target-steam-deck-and-8pct-target-linux/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the original article →</a></aside><section class=related-articles><h2>More Articles</h2><div class=related-grid><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-federal-cio-outlines-one-government-blueprint-for-overhaul/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769805679/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/federal-cio-outlines-one-government-blueprint-fo.jpg alt="GDC 2026 report: 36% of devs use GenAI; 28% target Steam Deck and 8% target Linux" loading=lazy><div class=related-card-content><h3>Federal CIO outlines 'one government' blueprint for …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-the-best-ai-stock-that-nobody-s-talking-about-for-2026/><div class=related-card-content><h3>The Best AI Stock That Nobody's Talking About for 2026</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-buzz-about-broadcom-s-custom-chips-is-testing-but-not-break/><div class=related-card-content><h3>Buzz about Broadcom's custom chips is testing, but not …</h3><time datetime=2026-01-30>Jan 30, 2026</time></div></a></div></section></article><script>(function(){const e=document.getElementById("reading-progress");if(!e)return;function t(){const n=window.scrollY,t=document.documentElement.scrollHeight-window.innerHeight,s=t>0?n/t*100:0;e.style.width=Math.min(100,s)+"%"}window.addEventListener("scroll",t,{passive:!0}),t()})()</script></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
