This article and its content was created prior to his current position with AWS.</p><p>One of the core capabilities of a warehouse management system (WMS) is its put-away engine. A put-away engine allows warehouses to model the business logic that determines where each product should be stored at the time it is received into the warehouse. Every WMS provides the ability to configure put-away rules, and during put-away execution, those rules are evaluated to determine the correct destination bin. When rules do not return a valid result, the system either presents an error or defaults to a fallback bin.</p><p>However, building and maintaining these put-away rules requires significant configuration effort. Even small changes demand extensive regression testing, because put-away rules are foundational to system-directed inbound operations. In high-volume environments, performance is also critical. Operators cannot wait for the system to determine storage locations; decisions must return in seconds. This makes put-away configuration both high-risk and high-effort.</p><p>With recent advancements in AI, this article explores whether AI and machine learning (ML) can simplify put-away configuration &ndash; either by reducing the complexity of put-away rules or by allowing AI to determine bin placement dynamically within defined storage boundaries. The article examines the challenges through two examples &ndash; put-away from inbound to storage in a build-to-order environment and put-away from inbound to outbound through opportunistic cross-docking.</p><p>Rather than proposing a definitive solution, this article explores whether recent advancements in AI and machine learning could offer an alternative way to think about bin-level decision-making within existing WMS constraints.</p><p>Put-away rules must be fully configured during the WMS implementation. Testing these rules is labor-intensive, and post-go-live adjus&mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.scmr.com/article/can-ai-help-simplify-put-away-rule-configuration-in-wms>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.scmr.com/article/can-ai-help-simplify-put-away-rule-configuration-in-wms target=_blank rel=noopener>Read the original article →</a></aside></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>&copy; 2026 Evofutura.
