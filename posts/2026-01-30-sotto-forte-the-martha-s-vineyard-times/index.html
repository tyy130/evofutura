After the tragic news of John Forté&rsquo;s death at the start of the year, we wanted to republish the piece to our main website. The original piece can be read here.</p><p>Interviewed by John Battelle</p><p>John Forté has made his home on Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard for nearly a decade, but he&rsquo;s been in love with the Island since his first visit back in 1998, when he came with a friend who just happened to be Ben Taylor, son of Island legends Carly Simon and James Taylor.

He served half of a fourteen-year sentence, and was pardoned by President George Bush at the urging of many of his supporters in the music world, including Simon, the woman he calls his &ldquo;second mama.&rdquo; Today, Forté splits his time between writing new music, composing for film and television, and collaborating with a dizzyingly diverse group of musicians, many of whom are also Islanders. He will be touring with Lauryn Hill and the Fugees later this summer and fall.</p><p>JB: Before we get into your connection to the Island and your musical legacy, I want to start with what you&rsquo;re working on now. You&rsquo;ve been in the studio most of the past winter, no?</p><p>JF: Yeah, working on something for HBO &ndash; &ldquo;Eyes On the Prize&rdquo; &ndash; an awardwinning series that began on PBS in the 80s. It chronicles the Black experience in America in the wake of the Civil Rights era.</p><p>It&rsquo;s moved to HBO?</p><p>Yeah, I spent much of last year working on it.
