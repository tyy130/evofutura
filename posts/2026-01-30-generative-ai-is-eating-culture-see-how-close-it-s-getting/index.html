See how close it&rsquo;s getting to disrupting dance</p><p>Dancers say their craft can&rsquo;t be duplicated by AI. Our tests show they&rsquo;re right &ndash; for now.</p><p>Bird singing and dancing, as practiced by the Cahuilla Band of Indians, tell a story about the creation of the world, and how the Cahuilla migrated to their current home in Southern California. Moving the same way your ancestors did, perhaps on the exact same land, makes you feel part of the past, present, and future all at once, said tribal member Emily Clarke. She&rsquo;s done bird dance with her loved ones since she was 7 years old &ndash; an act, she said, not only of spirituality but also of perseverance, since bird dance is among the acts of Native American culture nearly eradicated by colonization and U.S. government policy.</p><p>So when Clarke heard that some generative artificial intelligence models, like Google&rsquo;s Veo 3 and OpenAI&rsquo;s Sora 2, can mimic the dance, her first thought was that it was wrong, distasteful and disrespectful. Then she wondered briefly if automated forms of bird dance could help preserve her culture &ndash; before deciding they can&rsquo;t, since they will never replicate the conversations and community bonds that have helped give Cahuilla bird dance its distinct style and impassioned practitioners.</p><p>&ldquo;It would miss the cultural and social importance, and without that, it&rsquo;s not bird dancing,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>Developers of AI systems are working continuously to do an increasingly better job of replicating complex human movement, including dance. Doing so has become a sort of holy grail in the field of generative AI due to the many technical challenges involved, but it remains an open question among dancers like Clarke of how much the technology will disrupt the world of dance as it progresses.</p><p>Clarke&rsquo;s conflicting and uncertain thoughts about AI mirror those of other dancers across California interviewed by CalMatters, who were, depending on the specific question or moment in time, optimistic, sk&mldr;</p><p><a href=https://www.cnhinews.com/exchange/news/article_db273320-ff17-5e9e-8132-8bef762191e9.html>Read the original article</a></p></div><aside class=original-source><a href=https://www.cnhinews.com/exchange/news/article_db273320-ff17-5e9e-8132-8bef762191e9.html target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the original article →</a></aside><section class=related-articles><h2>More Articles</h2><div class=related-grid><a class=related-card href=https://evofutura.com/posts/2026-01-30-more-ai-security-noise-chatbots-going-rogue/><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/dg7khxdal/image/upload/v1769808516/evofutura/uploads/2026/01/more-ai-security-noise-chatbots-going-rogue.jpg alt="Generative AI is eating culture.
